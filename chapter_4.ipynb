      "As it has rocketed to some 100 million active users in record time, ChatGPT is provoking conversations about the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in drafting written materials such as student exams, news articles, legal pleadings, poems, and more. The chatbot, developed by OpenAI, relies on a large language model (LLM) to respond to user-submitted requests, or “prompts” as they are known. It is an example of generative AI, a technology that upends our understanding of who creates written materials and how they do it, challenging what it means to create, analyze, and express ideas.\n",

      "Rulemaking by federal agencies is a very text-intensive process, both in terms of writing the rules themselves, which express not only the law but also the agencies’ rationales for their regulatory choices, as well as public comments which arrive almost exclusively in the form of text. How might generative AI intersect with rulemaking? In this essay, we work through some use cases for generative AI in the rulemaking process, for better and for worse, both for the public and federal agencies.\n",
      "Public comments and generative AI\n",
      "For the public, generative AI might help people structure their information and views into public comments that have a better chance of influencing agency decisions. While agencies usually permit commenters to send in whatever text they want, more sophisticated comments tend to follow a professional format that contains substantive and sometimes highly technical information. A fairly constant worry with respect to public participation in rulemaking is that special interests overtake diffuse interests due to collective action problems. While readers of this series likely follow rulemaking closely, regulation remains esoteric for most people. Even for those aware of the rulemaking process, figuring out the style and content of a comment might seem out of reach. (Brookings published a helpful guide to commenting, by the way.) Scholars and policymakers disagree about the extent to which the public’s awareness of and participation in rulemaking is a problem that needs to be remedied, but at a minimum a tool that helps interested people compose a persuasive comment could be useful.\n",
      "Someone could, for example, prompt a generative AI tool to summarize that person’s position on a proposal and knit it into a comment that looks organized and clear. The prompt could be something like: “Write a comment to the Consumer Product Safety Commission telling them that I support their proposed rule on fireworks.” Even better, the prompt could guide the AI to emphasize specific concepts or reasons for the person’s views: “Write a comment to the Consumer Product Safety Commission telling them that I support their proposed rule on fireworks because fireworks can be traumatic for little kids and pets.” In our experience, ChatGPT can readily create convincing public submissions based on such straightforward prompts. For one Department of Labor proposal, simply requesting that the chatbot produce several paragraphs objecting to the rule resulted in text comparable to a mass comment campaign submission, and the content was quickly inverted by asking for a supportive comment.\n",
      "Generative AI also takes the possibility of “mass” and “malattributed” comments to the next level. Mass comments are “identical and near-duplicate comments” that are often “sponsored by organizations and submitted by group members and supporters to government agencies in response to proposed rules.” A team of researchers from The George Washington University and the Israel Democracy Institute wrote about the political reasons why groups organize these campaigns, likening them to the kind of lobbying activity that happens in Congress and other venues. Whether these mass comment campaigns actually influence agencies is the subject of some debate. The laws governing regulatory decisions generally do not call upon, or allow, the agencies to factor in public opinion; rather, agencies seek substantive and technical information from public comments. And the number of comments received is not a reliable proxy for general public opinion anyway because such submissions are not made by a representative sample of the population—even setting aside the possibility that some of the comments were not sent by real people, a possibility that generative AI increases. So most observers (with Professor Nina Mendelson a notable exception) have been dismissive of the role of mass comment campaigns in agency rulemaking decisions. Yet mass comment campaigns persist, for reasons that political scientists like Devin Judge-Lord are exploring in ongoing research. The reality is that generative AI arrives at a time when mass comment campaigns are a regular, if not frequent, component of rulemaking, so we can expect the two to intersect.\n",

      "Combining generative AI with mass comment campaigns could lead to mass comments that look less duplicative in nature, as the same idea could be expressed in many different ways with some support from an AI tool. Agencies currently have access to language processing tools that allow them to group comments based on the similarity of their text. This helps agencies meet their burden under the law to consider and respond to all significant comments. More varied comments will strain the current set of tools and likely lead to increased agency resources dedicated to comment analysis. That could further slow the already cumbersome rulemaking process, as agencies figure out how to cope with large and overwhelming volumes of differentiated and ostensibly substantive comments. For advocates looking to gum up the works, this could be an appealing tactic.\n",
      "In response, and following the approach they took in response to mass comment campaigns, agencies might be tempted to spend resources to develop tools to help identify which comments were generated by an AI rather than a human. Such tools are already in production for other purposes. While these tools are not “fully reliable,” they could alert agency staff that a comment they’re reviewing is likely generated by AI. It is not immediately clear how an agency would make use of such information, however, because the Administrative Procedure Act only requires that the commenter is a “person,” and a person could have submitted the comment, no matter who or what drafted it. Perhaps the alert could encourage agency staff to read the comment with some skepticism, but it’s not obvious at this point that such an approach would be reasoned or fair.\n",
      "Generative AI can be viewed as part of an ongoing tit-for-tat for public participation, with commenters deploying more sophisticated commenting methods and agencies attempting to respond with their own technology. Such an arms race is a waste of resources, though, if the end result is a large body of comments that neither represent the views of the general public nor offer novel and reliable information to the agency. More comments do not necessarily lead to better regulatory choices. The “arms race” frame is also troubling as applied to public input in a process intended to welcome it. Whether the type of participation that generative AI facilitates is the right kind of participation is part of what makes it such a provocative development.\n",
      "If generative AI adds to the richness of mass comments, that could be an improvement over many mass comment campaigns which tend to express up-or-down sentiment. Personal stories woven into comments can sometimes shed light on problems that agencies did not anticipate—the question is whether generative AI is poised to actually elucidate such richness or simply fake it. If regulators end up altering rules because of convincing but made-up “facts,” that would certainly be a step backward. In our experience, agency staff work hard to substantiate the information provided to them by public comments rather than accepting them at face value, but it is not implausible to imagine such safeguards breaking down. In that case, the potential for review in the courts offers an important backstop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI arrives at a time when mass comment campaigns are a regular, if not frequent, component of rulemaking, so we can expect the two to intersect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking this analysis one step further, Professor Michael Herz coined the term “malattributed comments” after the spectacle that accompanied the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) Net Neutrality rulemaking, in which millions of public comments claimed to be from people who either did not exist or who did not actually send comments. In a study commissioned by the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), researchers (including one of us) concluded that the risks of an agency being misled by malattributed comments are lower than might be expected because of the way agencies evaluate comments.1 Generative AI disturbs this equilibrium because it may help bad actors generate comments that look more persuasive, i.e., comments that seemingly present evidence beyond mere sentiment.\n",
      "By reducing the costs of producing “malattributed” comments, generative AI could lead to a pooling equilibrium—to borrow a concept from game theory that is often applied to insurance markets—where agencies can no longer meaningfully distinguish between valid and malicious comments. Agencies could then be inclined to assume all comments might be “fake” and discount their relevance, weakening public commenting as an avenue for meaningful public input and the formulation of improved policies and, ultimately, making people worse off. That need not come to pass, however. The Administrative Procedure Act does not permit agencies to entirely dismiss all public comments in this manner, nor does it categorically prohibit the public from using AI to aid in comment creation. Agencies also have a track record of collaborating to address novel issues, such as mass comment campaigns, via the eRulemaking program, and we expect that work to continue. Overall, as commenters reach for ways to use generative AI, agencies would be wise to lean on this existing governance structure as they consider potential responses.\n",
      "Agency workflows and generative AI\n",
      "Generative AI also offers some promises and perils for internal agency processes. Beyond malattributed comments, one worry is that flooding rulemaking dockets with a virtually unlimited supply of unique comments would incapacitate government systems and prevent other users from submitting public input. While these fears are alarming, the rulemaking system is fairly robust to a torrent of bot-generated comments. More specifically, Regulations.gov—the site that a majority of agencies use to accept public submissions on rules—already implements several techniques to manage large volumes of comments.\n",
      "First, Regulations.gov employs a CAPTCHA system developed by Google to distinguish between humans and bots. This prevents a computer program from automating comment submissions through the web interface, meaning that bad actors who want to spam the system would need to do so manually. In fact, one paper warning against the risk of bot submissions to rulemakings suggested this very solution. Second, the Regulations.gov Application Programming Interface (API) provides a way for organizations to submit multiple comments in an automated fashion—within certain limits. The API, which is managed by the General Services Administration (GSA), requires adherence to terms of service and uses a key to authenticate post submissions. Accordingly, GSA can also revoke access when it detects malicious activity. Further, submissions are constrained by a limit of 50 per minute or 500 per hour (whichever is reached first). This throttling inhibits malicious users from overwhelming the system before being identified and could be made stricter if necessary. While these safeguards are not foolproof, they provide meaningful protections against incapacitating the comment system with AI-generated text.\n",
      "Another worry is that the government could be misled by AI-generated comments. The text from generative AI can be very convincing, even if it is entirely untrue. This is because LLMs draw from voluminous writings by humans. They are essentially extremely big text prediction models that select the next word, phrase, or punctuation according to sample texts that they have been trained on (i.e., the texts fed to the model as examples for it to learn from); they are not a lookup table or encyclopedia. ChatGPT is not connected to the internet and its training data stop in 2021, but it can still generate plausible analyses of current articles based on information gleaned from prompts and its training data. Even LLMs connected to the internet, such as Bing AI, have a tendency to make up or “hallucinate” information, especially in contexts lacking training data.2 Relatedly, they offer more tailored answers in areas where they have received more training. In this context, public comments on rules are available on Regulations.gov going back many years, making them a rich source of training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the likely pace of development for generative AI, the federal government needs to be prepared to adapt to this intriguing new set of tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this backdrop, someone could prompt a generative AI tool to write a comment that supports or criticizes a rule based on fake scientific data or other technical information.3 Interestingly, the public can already submit fake information to an agency.4 It is currently the agency’s responsibility to wade through public comments and discern which information is or is not reliable; this is part of why it can take agencies months or years to finalize rules once they have been proposed. While the rulemaking process can be criticized for its length, taking time to discern the weight of public comments helps protect against challenges to the rulemaking process’ integrity, whether they come from generative AI or other sources. The possibility raised above of a large number of authentic, substantive, and varied comments does give us some pause because such comments would not violate the terms of service and could therefore spike agency workloads. It may be a challenge to balance the policy goal of a notice-and-comment process that is open to all with the reality of limited agency resources to consider so much information. This could be an area ripe for enhancing executive branch and congressional oversight of agency rulemaking.\n",
      "Generative AI could also help agency staff summarize and respond to comments received on the rules. A strength of LLMs is their ability to process and compose information based on their training data; regulators could use this to their advantage, especially if agencies had access to a model trained on public comments or texts related to the content of a rulemaking. Further, LLMs are most useful when combined with expertise because the information produced by the AI can be verified and supplemented by those with subject matter or “topic” knowledge. For example, an LLM could help regulators summarize comments on the proposal, classify feedback based on predefined categories, and cluster information based on similarities in content, style, or other features. Then, agency staff could provide a rough outline of responses to comments and prompt a generative AI to format them in the style of a rulemaking published in the Federal Register. This workflow would incorporate a more sophisticated set of tools than what agencies currently use to analyze and respond to public comments. While we are not in a position to say whether the federal government will actually invest in generative AI technologies, the capability is there. One pathway would be to fine-tune existing models like OpenAI’s GPT 3.5 (the basis for ChatGPT) for the rulemaking context.5 This could entail an agency customizing an existing LLM to better apply to its rulemaking activity by conducting additional training with relevant texts. For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could fine-tune GPT 3.5 for use by its Office of Air and Radiation by feeding it examples of its responses to comments from prior rules and topic-specific materials on the Clean Air Act.\n",
      "Using AI to support agency workflows, including analyzing public comments, sits in tension with current notions of who is supposed to do the “thinking work” of the government. One of us has written about this recently (with co-author Professor Rachel A. Potter) in the context of regulations that are drafted by government contractors, exploring whether drafting rules should be considered an “inherently governmental function” that is off-limits to contractors. While contractors can serve as vital supplements to agency capacity or expertise, overreliance on contractors can introduce conflicts of interest and other risks into the process. Generative AI offers an interesting twist on this concern. Might generative AI be more conflicted or biased than an outside contractor, less conflicted or biased, or might it simply present entirely different considerations? Because an LLM’s training data inform the way it generates text, using it to draft regulatory material could therefore reinforce the status quo in some circumstances and, in others, help create new connections in human knowledge. Of course, existing approaches to crafting rules are not without their own biases, nor are other tools (e.g., Google searches) that have become commonplace in policymaking. We are only at the beginning of working through these issues as they apply to this essential form of executive branch lawmaking.\n",
      "We limited this essay to generative AI, one of many technologies that intersect with rulemaking comments. Other tools could, for example, help alert people to rules that interest them and help the government catch errors and omissions in their analyses. The technology of rulemaking evolves along with the rest of society, and regulators should consider how to take advantage of the upside of tools like generative AI while minimizing their risks. One thing is sure: Given the likely pace of development for generative AI, the federal government needs to be prepared to adapt to this intriguing new set of tools.\n",

      "TITLE: The implications of a USAID shutdown\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "Over the past few weeks, the Trump administration has frozen U.S. foreign assistance, appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as acting administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and announced a review of the agency’s activities.\n",
      "With USAID’s future unclear, Brookings experts weigh in on the implications of a shutdown or reorganization, for the United States and for the world.\n",
      "The Trump administration’s reported plans to abolish the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) by presidential fiat raise serious questions of constitutional law. While USAID was originally created by executive order, Congress has statutorily mandated its existence since the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 and routinely reinforces this status through authorization and appropriations legislation. Recent annual appropriations legislation also prohibits any reorganization of USAID without prior consultation with relevant congressional committees. Ignoring these statutes would be tantamount to an extraordinarily broad claim of exclusive constitutional authority by the president over the structure of the executive branch. This view is hard to reconcile with either conventional views on Congress’ authority over the creation of federal offices or the current Supreme Court’s approach to major questions and the interpretation of ambiguous statutes, which generally serve to constrain executive branch discretion. For this reason, it would run a serious risk of being invalidated when inevitably challenged in the federal courts, most likely by a USAID employee or aid recipient who suffered adverse consequences as a result of the change.\n",
      "Perhaps for this reason, the Trump administration may now be backing down. On February 3, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that he was the new acting Administrator of USAID and that he was appointing Peter Marocco—a Trump loyalist and the controversial head of the State Department’s foreign assistance bureau responsible for the ongoing freeze of foreign assistance activities—as acting deputy administrator. In this capacity, Rubio notified Congress that Marocco would be leading “a review and potential reorganization of USAID’s activities” and that, “in consultation with Congress, USAID may move, reorganize, and integrate certain missions, bureaus, and offices into the Department of State, and the remainder of the Agency may be abolished consistent with applicable law” (italics added by author). While still potentially damaging to USAID’s mission, many of these more limited steps—dual hatting senior officials, reorganizing within USAID, and returning certain delegated functions to the State Department—can likely be accomplished under existing authorities, raising fewer legal concerns. Moreover, Rubio’s notice—which was itself framed as satisfying statutory notice requirements in recent appropriations legislation—suggests an intent to work with Congress on USAID reform instead of working around it, particularly if it wishes to pursue abolition or other measures contrary to existing statutes.\n",
      "Only time will tell, however, whether these overtures are in good faith or a feint while the Trump administration continues to pursue a more disruptive and legally questionable route forward.\n",
      "Abolishing the congressionally funded USAID would hurt U.S. interests in multiple ways that go beyond the core principle of U.S. policy to save lives.\n",
      "USAID’s efforts to prevent conflict around the world, encourage democratic and pluralistic processes and protect human rights, reduce suffering from death and disease, encourage sustainable economic growth, and prevent environmental destruction reflect the essence of the United States. They help build an international environment that services U.S. interests and values.\n",
      "They also constitute soft power projection to compete against Russia’s and China’s anti-American posture and activities around the world. As China expands its diplomatic and economic influence around the world, American support for systems of oversight, accountability, and sustainable economic and environmental decisions helps prevent China from entrapping countries in debt and diplomatic subservience and from monopolizing critical minerals or strategic access points, about which the Trump administration is so concerned with respect to the Panama Canal.\n",
      "At the time when Russia is selling its military services and engaging in egregious aggression, USAID programming that prevents and diffuses conflict and counters Moscow’s misinformation and disinformation campaigns is an important tool to mitigate Russia’s pernicious influence.\n",
      "USAID’s efforts also prevent the spread of deadly terrorism that still boils across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia and affects Americans and U.S. assets too. Programs that lift people out of poverty, foster economic development, encourage access to justice, and promote better governance address the root causes on which terrorism thrives.\n",
      "And efforts that prevent life-ending or debilitating illness and protect healthy ecosystems support sustainable economic growth, and prevent the global spread of infectious diseases that hurt U.S. citizens and the United States as well. All these USAID efforts help prevent the migration flows the Trump administration is so strongly determined to stop.\n",
      "While the Trump administration exempted assistance to Israel and Egypt from its foreign aid suspension, the abrupt rupture in U.S. support puts the fragile Israel-Lebanon ceasefire at risk. The November 27, 2024 ceasefire agreement was brokered by the Biden administration and France, reportedly with the approval and input of incoming Trump officials. According to its terms, a delicate sequence of events should have occurred by January 27: Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanon, Hezbollah pull-back and disarmament, and Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) deployment to secure southern Lebanon.\n",
      "With the White House having announced an extension of the ceasefire deadline to February 18, credible LAF deployment is essential. Deployment depends in part on restarting the U.S. program of military training and equipping, funded through U.S. Foreign Military Financing (FMF), now suspended under the Trump executive order.\n",
      "Hezbollah was seriously degraded by Israeli military action and faces a Shia base frustrated by the paltry sums available to rebuild communities shattered in last autumn’s war. A once-in-a-generation opportunity exists to support a Lebanon not held hostage to Hezbollah and to build a secure Israel-Lebanon border after decades of instability and outbreaks of war. A newly elected Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, and a nominated prime minister candidate, Nawaf Salam, have publicly called for a Lebanon with one army that can secure its borders against arms smuggling. Cutting U.S. support for Lebanon (which goes beyond LAF support) just at the moment when Lebanese politicians are finally willing to try to break Hezbollah’s stranglehold pulls the political rug out from under these courageous leaders.\n",
      "If the Israelis refuse to withdraw from southern Lebanon because the LAF lacks the support to fill the vacuum, Hezbollah will seize the opportunity to rebuild the narrative that “resistance,” not diplomacy or the national army, is the only response to Israeli occupation. Violence will reignite. Most U.S. administrations would recognize, in fact, that conditions are finally in place for Lebanon to emerge sovereign and posing no threat to its neighbors. A decades-long U.S. policy goal is finally in reach. In other words, time to increase, not suspend, U.S. support. \n",
      "It is disheartening that the second Trump administration has abandoned the core support it gave to the core tenets of the gender equality and female empowerment policy during its first administration and to initiatives that supported it. Launched in February 2019, the first Trump administration’s Women’s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative sought to reach millions of women in low-income countries by 2025 through focusing on workforce development, entrepreneurship, and an enabling environment for women to succeed. But that administration also went beyond economic issues. In 2017, the president signed into law the Women, Peace, and Security Act (Public Law 115-68), making this the first legislation of its kind to acknowledge the multifaceted roles of women throughout the conflict spectrum. In June 2019, the U.S. government released the U.S. Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS Strategy), making the U.S. the first country in the world with both a comprehensive law and whole-of-government strategy on WPS.\n",
      "The USAID shutdown stalls progress toward economic prosperity and stability. It stops support for cash transfers that reach the poorest households, halts financing for women farmers who produce food and other staples, stops lifesaving health services, and disrupts public-private partnerships to help women compete in the digital economy, to name just a few core programs. Beyond support for people in need, it suspends support for key tools of policymaking, including data production and knowledge. USAID is the largest supporter of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program, which has collected high quality data on health, nutrition, and demographic trends in more than 90 countries since 1984. In many cases, the DHS is the only source of information on a country’s population.\n",
      "People around the world have looked to USAID to champion the values of human dignity and respect for all. This administration damages that trust and makes it harder for the U.S. to be a reliable and influential partner in efforts to make the world safer and more prosperous.\n",
      "USAID’s hostile takeover is a clear signal to the U.S. Department of Education (ED): Look out, you’re next!\n",
      "Like USAID, Republicans have long questioned ED’s usefulness while out of power, though that talk typically evaporated once in the White House. In fact, Republicans presided at the times when ED’s influence over public schools increased most. The first Trump term also followed this pattern: In 2016, then-candidate Trump proposed abolishing ED; though after inauguration, ED operated more or less in line with prior administrations preceding it under Secretary Betsy DeVos (aside from reversing many Obama-era initiatives). Trump released a federal government reform plan in 2018 that included merging ED under the Labor Department, though that proposal went nowhere.\n",
      "The reason for ED’s dogged persistence is that Congress must sign off on changes to its structure or budget, which is less vulnerable to presidential whims. Thus, Trump’s campaign talk and the Project 2025 proposals to eliminate ED have again been widely panned as not credible threats. Merely two weeks ago, I moderated a webinar with three former secretaries of education who all offered constructive suggestions for strategic reforms amid Trump’s talk of downsizing the ED, though none viewed its closure as realistic or productive.\n",
      "But with last week’s moves at USAID, ED’s status is now in peril. President Trump, relying on Elon Musk and the quasi-governmental Department of Government Efficiency, is taking decisive actions at USAID first despite congressional pushback, established spending laws, and employment protections. They are clearly willing to push well beyond the limits to achieve their objectives.\n",
      "Yesterday, media reports surfaced of Trump’s imminent plans for a similar hollowing out of ED that includes placing many staff on administrative leave, shutting down some ED functions, and spinning off others. If this comes to pass, students in all American schools will feel the reverberations of these actions—potentially impacting funding for low-income or disabled students, education research functions, and the protections of students’ civil rights. This is the wrong curriculum for the nation’s ailing students and institutions still reeling from the pandemic.\n",
      "In the first two weeks of the Trump administration, the U.S. foreign aid program has been disrupted by a combination of ill-considered actions and circumvention of the role and laws enacted by Congress.\n",
      "These have included: a freeze on most foreign assistance without accompanying clear guidance or process for waivers; sending home 60 senior career policy officials and then some 1,000 contract personnel who do the work of managing foreign assistance; removing career officials who refuse to execute illegal orders; giving unauthorized civilians working for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to the USAID systems that contain the agency’s data.\n",
      "Finally on day 15 (February 3), the administration honored a congressional mandate. Secretary of State Rubio sent a letter to congressional committees initiating a consultative process on moving functions of USAID into the Department of State. This meets the requirement in section 7036 of the 2024 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibiting any reorganization of USAID and the Department of State without consulting Congress.\n",
      "The question now is, given the ongoing circumvention of the law and the congressional power of the purse, will the administration respect the consultation process?\n",
      "The reason this is an issue is the administration can in any case execute de facto merger of most of USAID’s functions without congressional action. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 established USAID as an independent agency, with the administrator receiving foreign policy guidance from the secretary of state. Both USAID and the Department of State (along with some 20 other U.S. government agencies) implement foreign assistance programs. But since the creation of the State Department Office of the Director of Foreign Assistance (known as F) in 2006, State has exercised increasing authority over USAID programs.\n",
      "So, will the Congress stand up against ill-considered dismantling of USAID—impacting on its more than 10,000 staff and hundreds of thousands of intended beneficiaries around the world and damaging the U.S. reputation as a reliable ally—as a few members of Congress are beginning to do, and demand that the law and regular procedures be honored?\n",
      "Elon Musk’s attempts to close USAID are not only illegal, they are also fundamentally incompatible with the United States’ national interest. Throughout the world, USAID has been a strong supporter of U.S. diplomacy, partnering with governments and civil society alike to further local development and strengthen institutions.\n",
      "The record of USAID in Indonesia is instructive. In recent decades, USAID has invested in democracy, good governance, environmental stewardship, infrastructural development, and other critical programs to support this important strategic partner in the Asia Pacific. USAID’s presence in Indonesia ensures that the United States is an active participant in Indonesia’s economic transformation, supporting close government-to-government relations while ensuring that U.S. strategic competitors do not gain a geopolitical advantage in the region.\n",
      "Congress must immediately put an end to Elon Musk’s presence in the federal government, demand legislative accountability under the law, and take back control over this important national asset for the good of the United States.\n",
      "The policy issues at the heart of the Trump administration’s actions concerning USAID are ones that previous administrations across the political spectrum have grappled with. The manner in which the administration has pursued these, however, is hurting U.S. interests abroad and potentially putting it at odds with the constitution at home.\n",
      "Incoming administrations regularly undertake a review to align spending with priorities. However, putting a freeze on spending while the review is underway—especially for up to 90 days in some of the most challenging places in the world—triggers a practical conclusion: Most implementers receiving the funding will be unable to stop and restart their projects, so the decision is in effect already made.\n",
      "The abrupt removal of a significant portion of the USAID’s staff and expertise adds to the inability to restart and meet congressional mandates on spending. This is independent of Secretary of State Rubio’s February 3 letter to Congress about the potential for merging the independent agency into the Department of State. Both issues call into question the boundaries of executive versus legislative authorities.\n",
      "The cessation and sudden downsizing are undermining U.S. credibility internationally and increasing national security risks. They also have the potential for significant long-term effects on U.S. economic interests.\n",
      "In a 2017 analysis, 11 of the 15 largest trading partners of the U.S. were former recipients of aid, but countries today have many options as they react to the sudden unreliability of the United States. China, for example, has expanded its global footprint significantly and has spent over $1 trillion globally since 2013 through its Belt and Road initiative.\n",
      "It’s worth considering some of the organizations affected by a freeze. USAID’s largest implementing partner in 2024 was Catholic Relief Services. Samaritan’s Purse, an organization founded by Billy Graham’s son Franklin, has received over $90 million from USAID over the last four years to support its efforts around the world. USAID’s activities are a reflection of how many Americans wish to walk and be viewed in the world.\n",
      "In the 1990s, at the end of the Cold War, USAID experienced a reduction in staff and resources. After the atrocities on 9/11, however, USAID’s obligations grew significantly and immediately—by 70% between 2001 to 2003—because policymakers in Congress and presidential administrations recognized that addressing poverty, improving health, and supporting economic growth overseas made America safer at home. Today’s world is too dangerous to court making history repeat itself.\n",
      "International aid has always had a spectrum of goals, from altruistic intentions of helping others to advancing political, economic, and military self-interest. Like other aid organizations, USAID has operated within this multiplicity of intentions across all administrations. I have seen firsthand how these different goals interact. Many aid programs drive meaningful change—helping young people gain employment, supporting clinics that deliver life-saving care, increasing agricultural productivity, and increasing access to education for millions of children. However, I have seen other programs where aid served political objectives rather than its stated mission. In one instance, a $90 million USAID education project was designed to prioritize the education minister’s political ambitions over systematically improving the teacher education project. In another case, USAID project representatives, including myself, were explicitly informed in a NATO briefing that our primary mission was counterinsurgency rather than development.\n",
      "The Trump administration’s decision to freeze USAID’s activities, and a potential move to shut it down, shifts U.S. foreign assistance toward the administration’s immediate political objectives while deprioritizing long-term global aid priorities. While officials argue that these changes are intended to improve efficiency and accountability, the administration’s rhetoric has largely framed aid in transactional terms rather than as an instrument of long-term global leadership. Although this could be viewed as a more transparent approach to aid, it risks undermining the long-term interests of the United States.\n",
      "While aid has, at times, been used to impose ideas in ways that have fueled conflict, this is not an argument for making it purely transactional but for reforming it to reflect our global responsibility better. Rather than reducing foreign assistance to a short-term political instrument, the Trump administration should seek a model that aligns global responsibility with long-term U.S. interests. Historically, U.S. foreign aid has been most effective when it reinforces American leadership through sustained partnerships, moral responsibility, and shared global prosperity by designing programs collaboratively with local partners. An example of the discussion of how we can move toward a more effective and sustainable aid strategy can be found here. The question is not whether aid should serve national interests—it always must—but whether it does so while maintaining our global responsibility. Thoughtful reform can ensure that U.S. aid policy remains a vital tool for both advancing American values and strengthening its long-term global influence.\n",
      "The efforts by the Trump administration—particularly the Elon Musk-led task force known as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—to dismantle USAID stand to have major short- and long-term consequences for individuals who rely on foreign assistance around the world and U.S. foreign policy objectives alike. But it should also be understood in the context of a broader, direct assault by the executive branch on congressional power.\n",
      "On his first day in office, President Trump issued several executive orders freezing certain federal funds—including one halting the vast majority of foreign assistance programs. The following week, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo directing agencies to “temporarily pause all activities” related to the disbursement of grants, loans, and other federal financial assistance. Subsequent actions by federal courts directed the OMB to lift the freeze, and going forward, the executive branch may find that specific statutes do provide it more legal flexibility over the flow of federal funds.\n",
      "But in the meantime, a broad attack on the congressional power of the purse continues, and the attempted dismantling of USAID is part of it. The agency was created in 1961 to implement a set of congressionally-authorized aid programs, and Congress has continued to appropriate funds for the agency’s use since then—including as recently as December 2024, when the agency’s activities were included in the continuing resolution currently funding federal discretionary programs through March 14. If the Trump administration is successful in circumventing Congress’ intention for the agency and its programs to operate, it may well try the same play with other departments and functions important to the American people.\n",
      "With the suspension of USAID funding, the implementation of the 2020 Global Thrive Act is at risk, as is aid to millions of vulnerable children around the world. The law, which focuses on supporting vulnerable children and families—those who are poor, orphaned, living with HIV/AIDS, disabled, or impacted by humanitarian crises—requires U.S. government agencies to “incorporate early childhood development into current programs and promote inclusive early childhood development in partner countries.”\n",
      "As part of this mandate, USAID is charged with coordinating an interagency effort to implement the “Advancing Protection and Care for Children in Adversity to Thrive” strategy in order to achieve holistic results for young children (birth to 8 years) in places like Rwanda, Cambodia, and Mozambique. The strategy prioritizes:\n",
      "The U.S. is the largest donor worldwide for children. But with this law and its implementation paused, even if ultimately for only 90 days, millions of children’s and families’ lives are at risk.\n",
      "The shutdown of USAID programs will have far-reaching consequences for Africans, Americans, and U.S.-Africa relations. Africans have long benefited from USAID’s key development programs, including more than $6.5 billion in humanitarian aid last year. American citizens and corporations have benefited from the private sector engagement with a continent home to 11 of the top 20 fastest growing economies in the world, while relations between the two regions reap benefits from this history of partnership.\n",
      "USAID programs have been credited to have saved more than 25 million lives, the majority of which are African, from HIV/AIDS (via PEPFAR), with health programs accounting for about 70% of the United States’ annual State Department and USAID-administered aid allocations. Following health, U.S. aid allocations prioritize economic growth initiatives including agricultural development aid, peace and security, education and social services, and democracy, human rights, and governance, leading to key achievements such as closing $86 billion worth of private sector deals and providing new or improved electricity access to 180 million people in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "African prosperity is linked to American prosperity. Shutting down USAID programs related to governance and stability threatens international security, while cuts to health programs that fund the fight against infectious diseases put American health at risk. If the U.S. withdraws, it risks losing the geopolitical competition in Africa to countries such China, Russia, and the Gulf States, which continue to deepen their ties to the continent through economic, military, and critical mineral partnerships. The decision to cut USAID means giving up key soft power and geopolitical influence at a critical time in history where Africa will shape the world’s future. By 2050, 1 in 4 people and 1 in 3 young people will hail from the continent, where they will be at the forefront of solving global challenges by driving innovations. USAID initiatives have provided a way for the U.S. to work with Africa to help shape the future while promoting American ideals of democracy and freedom. The shutdown of these initiatives represents both a risk and a missed opportunity.\n",

      "TITLE: How will the Biden administration’s China policy be remembered?\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "When President Joe Biden entered office on January 20, 2021, America’s economy was cratering. The country was navigating its worst public health emergency in 100 years. Shards of debris were still being swept from areas where protesters had violently attacked the country’s democratic foundations just two weeks earlier in a coordinated attack on the peaceful transfer of power. Abroad, support for America’s leadership had plummeted. America’s relations with allies and partners were under strain after years of unilateralism.\n",
      "China, meanwhile, appeared to be on the ascent. Economists were exploring when—not if—China’s economy would surpass America’s in terms of gross domestic product. China appeared to be gaining ground militarily through a broad build-out of a wide array of advanced capabilities. Many U.S. military and intelligence officials were forming a conclusion that China could invade Taiwan by 2027.  This was the strategic environment within which the Biden administration charted its initial policy moves toward China.\n",
      "From the outset, Biden and his advisors determined that several policy adjustments would be needed following the Trump administration to respond to a more assertive and capable China. The first was to return alliances and partnerships to the center of American foreign policy. The Biden administration studiously engaged with allies and partners in Asia and Europe before reaching out to Chinese officials. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s first contact with his Chinese counterpart was not until February 5, 2021, nearly three weeks into the presidential term and well after he had prioritized speaking with America’s partners. Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also did not meet face-to-face with their Chinese counterparts until Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had first traveled to Seoul and Tokyo to consult directly with their alliance partners. I will return to Blinken and Sullivan’s initial meeting with counterparts from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) shortly.\n",
      "Additionally, the Biden administration put an early emphasis in its China policy on democracy and human rights. From the outset, Biden administration officials stressed their concerns about developments in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet, and the state of human rights in China broadly.  Biden and his staff helped push the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law during his first year in office. This act deemed that any products from Xinjiang would be presumed to be made with forced labor and thus barred from entry into the United States unless the importer could provide convincing evidence to overcome this presumption. The Biden administration also imposed sanctions and travel restrictions on Chinese officials involved in human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Additionally, Biden and members of his administration launched a Summit for Democracy in their first year. Biden declared the world was in a competition between democracy and autocracy.\n",
      "The Biden team also sought to present itself as representing a return to professionalism and steadiness after the tumultuous years of the Trump presidency. They cultivated a narrative of having experience, and in Biden’s case, personal knowledge about how Chinese President Xi Jinping thinks and operates, based on his past time spent with Xi as President Barack Obama’s vice president.\n",
      "The Biden administration also devoted considerable attention during its first and second years to securing congressional funding for the second major plank of its China strategy: turbocharging domestic American industry. Through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States allocated close to $2 trillion to support national investments in clean energy, semiconductor manufacturing and research and development, and modernization of America’s infrastructure. This signal of national purpose attracted record levels of foreign direct investment and also led to considerable crowding in of private capital in these sectors.\n",
      "Over time, the Biden team also significantly expanded export controls of sensitive and dual-use technologies to China. The administration homed in on specific chokepoints in semiconductor value chains where the United States and its partners are producers of specialized technologies and equipment and conducted painstaking diplomacy to bring allies together in implementing coordinated export controls. Such a united front of American and allied coordination on technological controls had never been developed against China on such a scale. Even critics of this approach would acknowledge that these and related efforts slowed China’s technological progress, the degree to which remains under debate.\n",
      "Biden’s three-pronged China strategy of strengthening alliances and building new partnerships; investing in industrial policy at home; and limiting technology exports to China achieved notable gains. At the most fundamental level, America was stronger and healthier, and its economy was measurably more dynamic at the end of Biden’s term than when he began. The gap in relative size between America’s economy and China’s economy widened in America’s direction over Biden’s term. This also was reflected in investment flows. Inbound investment into America jumped considerably, even as it declined 80% in China between 2022-2023, reaching 30-year lows. A similar story applies to stock market performance. The S&P 500 rose around 54% during Biden’s term, while China’s stock markets underperformed and declined.\n",
      "At the end of Biden’s term, America was closely aligned with allies and partners in Europe and Asia, including in new configurations such as the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) alliance; the strengthening of the Quad group of countries involving Australia, India, Japan, and the United States; and the establishment of two separate trilateral alliance coordination mechanisms: one with Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea; and one among the United States, Japan, and the Philippines.\n",
      "Meanwhile, China no longer appears to be on an unstoppable ascent. China’s military brass is still mired in a seemingly endless cycle of revelations of corruption and purges, even as the People’s Liberation Army continues to field a wide array of advanced capabilities. China’s relations with virtually every developed democracy around the world are more turbulent than they were four years ago. Whereas China was on the verge of signing an investment agreement with the European Union on the eve of Biden’s inauguration, now China faces sanctions and tariffs in Europe. In Asia, China’s relations with Australia, Japan, South Korea, India, and Taiwan were simultaneously strained at the time of Biden’s exit. Even among developing countries that China has courted as a hedge against rising antagonism with developed democracies, China is beginning to run up against protectionist trade barriers in places like Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, Chile, and Mexico.\n",
      "In fairness, China also enjoys notable bright spots. The country has secured support for expanding the BRICS grouping to include new and prospective members, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. China’s investments in many developing countries have grown in recent years, encouraging greater complementarity between China and these countries. Chinese firms dominate a growing array of sectors, from clean energy to batteries, electric vehicles, drones, and shipbuilding. Chinese artificial intelligence startup companies, such as DeepSeek, have sent shockwaves through global markets as they have begun pushing the frontiers of innovation.\n",
      "On balance, though, China no longer enjoys the shadow of the future it once did as the unstoppable force for reordering the world in the 21st century. Many Chinese experts and officials recognize this shift in China’s fortunes but are struggling to reverse it, particularly as power becomes concentrated around the country’s top leaders. This concentration of power is leading to rigid and reactive policymaking that is eroding confidence inside the country about its own future.\n",
      "When Biden entered office, the U.S.-China relationship was dysfunctional. On the eve of Biden’s inauguration, channels of communication were reduced to a procedural dialogue on the implementation of a “Phase 1” trade agreement that was hardly worth the paper it was printed on. There was a perfunctory military channel to address irritants about operational behavior. Relations had grown so fraught that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff felt it necessary to reach out to his Chinese counterpart near the end of the Trump administration to disabuse rumors that the United States might launch a war with China. Such an unusual move was taken, in part, because no other channels functioned for clarifying intentions and setting expectations about the conduct of the relationship. Mutual recrimination over the origin of COVID-19 filled the vacuum.\n",
      "From that low starting point, the Biden administration over its four years rebuilt capacity to make headway on specific problems with China, even as it worked to shore up American competitiveness. The Biden administration secured Chinese law enforcement coordination in reducing the flow of fentanyl precursors and returning Chinese citizens who had entered the United States illegally. American diplomats negotiated the release of wrongfully detained American citizens. U.S. and Chinese military leaders restored connectivity between both country’s forces, including by establishing a new theater-level channel between the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and the People’s Liberation Army Southern Theater Command. Both militaries also resumed pre-notification of intercontinental ballistic missile launches and restarted efforts to address incidents through the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement. These efforts lowered the risk of military conflict. Importantly, Biden and Xi also agreed to maintain human control over all nuclear launch decisions and not to cede such decisionmaking to artificial intelligence, making them the first world leaders to reach such an understanding.\n",
      "The Biden team achieved this progress without pulling its punches on competitive actions it deemed necessary to push back against Chinese transgressions. The Biden team carried forward President Donald Trump’s China tariffs and added to them. The administration expanded the scope of export controls and introduced an outbound investment screening mechanism for American investments into sensitive sectors of China’s economy. It increased the use of human rights tools to sanction and restrict travel by Chinese officials. It tightened coordination with allies and partners on China, including on condemning China’s support for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, Beijing’s growing pressure on Taiwan, and China’s escalatory actions in the South China Sea. The Biden team also set new precedents in terms of American support for Taiwan, such as by making excess defense articles available to Taiwan, expanding the foreign military financing program to Taiwan, and Biden becoming the first president to vow publicly to defend Taiwan if it comes under PRC attack.\n",
      "Many of the Biden administration’s missteps on China policy can be traced back to a tendency to allow politics to drive policy. This tendency repeated itself throughout the Biden administration. For example, as the nominee for secretary of state, Blinken made news by declaring that China was engaging in genocide in Xinjiang. Blinken was already secure in his confirmation and did not need to create news in his hearing to become secretary of state. He easily could have indicated he would prioritize reviewing the available evidence to reach a judgment on whether China was committing genocide after he assumed office. This would have bought him time and space to use the ongoing review as leverage to push China to make specific observable changes in its behavior, and if it did not, render a judgment that genocide was being committed. Instead, Blinken publicly declared before he had even been sworn in that China’s authorities were genocidal. Such a move served as an early instance of political calculations taking precedence over sound diplomacy.\n",
      "The Biden team misjudged that its early finger-wagging condemnation of China would earn the administration applause from the American electorate. For example, the Biden administration’s first encounter with senior Chinese officials was a case study in diplomatic malpractice. Blinken and Sullivan decided to host their Chinese counterparts, Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi, for an ice-breaking meeting in Anchorage, Alaska. Rather than use this first contact to signal priorities, push back on areas of concern, and begin to build a forward-looking agenda for the relationship, Blinken and Sullivan crafted their perfunctory welcome greetings in front of the press as a condemnatory laundry list of Chinese misdeeds. This prompted Yang, China’s top diplomat, to erupt in defense of China’s national dignity, leading to an extended ping-pong volley of blamesmanship between U.S. and Chinese diplomats in front of the global media. Instead of demonstrating a return of competence and professionalism to the relationship, Blinken and Sullivan instead advertised their unpreparedness. They delivered a public spectacle that tainted the Biden team’s claim to be mature stewards of great power competition.\n",
      "Blinken never recovered from these early missteps and thus undermined his own capacity to conduct diplomacy with Chinese counterparts. Beijing viewed him throughout his tenure as a grandstanding point scorer that Chinese officials were obligated to tolerate, but never oblige. Sullivan did recover, eventually establishing a productive private channel with his Chinese counterpart to manage the most sensitive issues in the relationship.\n",
      "In August 2022, then-Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan. Before traveling, she indicated that she was determined to visit Taiwan, but that she would reconsider if Biden intervened directly with her. Biden never did so, but instead sent his staff to advise Pelosi on the harm her visit would generate for American interests. Pelosi proceeded to visit Taiwan. Beijing responded aggressively, including by erasing a de facto centerline in the Taiwan Strait that both sides of the Strait had observed for decades and by launching missiles over Taiwan.\n",
      "Several months later, in an effort to pull the relationship out of the spiral it was stuck in, Blinken planned a carefully orchestrated visit to Beijing in January 2023. Just as Blinken was preparing to depart for Beijing, news emerged that a Chinese spy balloon was drifting across the United States. Instead of using the incident as an opportunity to travel to Beijing, backfoot Chinese officials for violating American airspace, and laying out concrete steps those officials would need to take to dig themselves out of their self-made hole, Blinken caved to congressional Republican pressure for him to postpone his trip as a sign of displeasure. Blinken’s decision to briefly postpone his visit in deference to congressional pressure reinforced for Chinese senior officials that Blinken’s approach to China would blow with the political winds.\n",
      "Biden also fell into this trap of privileging politics above policy. Despite criticizing Trump’s tariffs against China during the 2020 campaign for harming American families, Biden caved to political pressure after entering office. He not only sustained Trump’s tariffs but added to them throughout his tenure. Biden and his advisors concluded that there were not any appreciable gains available for adjusting the tariffs that would offset the political risk of being accused of going soft on China by removing them. Predictably, during the 2024 election, Trump used Biden’s timidity on tariff adjustments to argue Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were weak followers and poor imitators of his own approach to China. Trump upped the ante during the campaign by challenging Harris to explain why the Biden administration had not increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% as he had begun advocating for.\n",
      "At a more fundamental level, the Biden administration appeared unable or unwilling to articulate any sense of purpose or direction to its strategy on China. Officially, members of the administration would point to Blinken’s policy speech whereby he explained that America would “invest, align, and compete” with China. Additionally, Sullivan and others often invoked the need for “managed competition” with China. They argued for intense diplomacy to leaven intense competition. In this vein, former Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell argued that America should focus on a steady state in its relationship with China rather than an end state. Such types of framing failed to identify specific benchmarks or goals that would amount to “wins” or even “progress” in America’s competition with China. Managing competition is a process, not an outcome or destination. Imploring Americans to pursue a steady state of managed competition proved too abstract to stimulate public emotion, commitment, or support.\n",
      "The American people are not enthusiastic about confrontation with China. Even though Biden and his advisors repeatedly and publicly conveyed that they sought to manage competition and avoid war, their rhetoric was belied by daily news about intensifying U.S.-China confrontation, spy balloons being shot down over U.S. territory, naval flare-ups in the South China Sea, and the prospect of war over Taiwan as soon as 2027.\n",
      "According to polling from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Americans’ foremost priority for U.S.-China relations is to avoid a military conflict. Sixty-nine percent of respondents viewed this goal as very important, even as they simultaneously recorded record levels of unfavourability toward China. Seventy-seven percent of Americans now hold an unfavorable view of China, far higher than at any point in recent decades, including in the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre on June 4, 1989.\n",
      "Put differently, while the American public strongly disapproves of Chinese conduct, their foremost interest is in ensuring their leaders manage relations with China in ways that will steer clear of conflict. Americans do not view the threat from China as an opportunity to rally around an external foe. Most Americans want their leaders to handle relations with China firmly and responsibly so that they do not need to add the prospect of war between nuclear-armed rivals to their list of daily concerns.\n",
      "Trump seemed intuitively to understand this American sentiment on the 2024 campaign trail. When one attempts to boil down the rambling bluster that characterizes Trump’s rhetoric, his core message on China has been that he knows how to get things done with Xi, he will be strong in dealing with China, and he will be a leader who ends wars and does not start them. In other words, Trump found a straightforward narrative on China that appealed to the American body politic in ways that eluded the far more eloquent rhetoric of Biden and his team.\n",
      "Without a narrative arc to explain the intended direction of strategy on China, a vacuum emerges that is often filled with information about the risks China poses to the United States. Over the past four years, for example, there has been ongoing discussion about the myriad ways in which China is the source of the problems that the American people confront, such as fentanyl, COVID-19, and the hollowing-out of America’s manufacturing sector. When China is presented as the antagonist and America as the victim, many Americans naturally feel vulnerable rather than secure. Reminders about national vulnerability sap public confidence in the strength of America’s leaders, rather than inspiring it. Biden failed to meet the moment in reassuring the American people that he had firm control over the China challenge. His primary shortcoming was not in specific policy design but in storytelling.\n",
      "Biden’s narrative on China paled in comparison to the sweeping rhetoric Franklin D. Roosevelt employed to rouse a shaken nation during World War II. It lacked the uplift that Ronald Reagan used to stir optimism in American competitiveness during the Cold War. It fell short of the reassurance George W. Bush provided after the attacks of September 11, 2001, to temper public fears.\n",
      "Biden and his advisors never attempted to emulate, for example, John F. Kennedy’s effort in his 1963 commencement speech at American University, “A Strategy for Peace.” In that speech, less than one year after the Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy laid bare the deep division between the United States and the Soviet Union and the profound risks of failing to responsibly manage the competition between both powers. But he also humanized the Cold War confrontation, reminding the American people, “We all cherish our children’s future,” and we all have a stake in averting war. Then Kennedy laid out steps he intended to take to drive progress on his strategy for peace.\n",
      "All these past leaders provided a vision, a sense of direction, and a national purpose during America’s previous periods of global competition. They explained what the stakes were, what America sought to achieve, and how it would go about doing so. Biden failed to match his predecessors’ performances on this score.\n",
      "Ultimately, history renders judgments on the impact of policies by their longevity and their results. George Kennan’s theory of containment of the Soviet Union offers a classic example of a strategy that had longevity and generated results. Similarly, Jean Monnet’s vision for the future of post-World War II Europe helped stamp out the embers of war and foster the emergence of the European Union.\n",
      "For all its worthy elements and the positive progress that it generated, Biden’s China strategy will not have staying power. Elements of Biden’s approach may endure, such as efforts around export controls and tariffs. Two of the core pillars of Biden’s China strategy—alliances and investments at home—are unlikely to find favor in the new Trump administration. This is not because Biden’s strategy lacks merit, but rather because it does not align with Trump’s conviction that economic growth is spurred by tax cuts and deregulation, and war is best averted through direct diplomacy with China’s leaders. As a result, Biden’s strategy will mostly be remembered as the interregnum between Trump’s two terms. This is not an indictment on the talented members of the Biden administration who built and executed the strategy, but rather a recognition of the reality that American politics has rendered.\n",
      "Regardless of what Trump does over the next four years, the U.S.-China relationship will remain a central feature of America’s foreign policy debates in 2028 and beyond. As the 2028 presidential cycle warms up, presidential candidates and their advisors would do well to study what worked, and importantly, what did not, from the Biden administration’s approach to China. On its merits, the strategy was sound; it put America in a stronger competitive position vis-à-vis China. Biden’s principal shortcoming was in convincing the American people that he had the U.S.-China relationship firmly under control. American leaders cannot succeed on charged foreign policy issues without explaining themselves convincingly and securing support from an anxious polity. This requires persistent presidential communication and storytelling. Such efforts will disappoint, though, if their primary purpose is to eke out incremental progress in congressional debates over specific pieces of legislation. To become remembered as historically impactful statesmen/women, leaders must rise above point-scoring and tactical political positioning. They must rally national support for their vision of harnessing American power to deliver a world that better protects the safety, health, and prosperity of the American people.\n",
      "America does not enjoy the luxury of deciding how the U.S.-China relationship is conducted. China’s leaders also get a vote. China’s leaders contributed mightily, arguably disproportionately, to the rivalry’s intensification in recent years. They will offer few favors to any presidential candidate who articulates a vision for the relationship that falls short of accommodating China’s ambitions. Even so, America’s leaders define the narrative inside the United States for what strategy is needed to make lives better for future generations. Past American leaders have drawn from a deep well of optimism and grit to build support behind strategies for America to outcompete its adversaries and prevail over its enemies. Future leaders will need to summon a similar spirit if they wish to advance a strategy on China that endures and has impact.\n",

      "TITLE: Higher new Census population estimates will affect the employment report\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "Over the past year, researchers have been deliberating about how to measure the size of the U.S. population. In early 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) published estimates suggesting much higher post-2020 population growth than previously estimated, largely stemming from an unanticipated surge in migration. Now the Census Bureau has revised its population estimates to be more closely aligned with the higher CBO numbers. This brief explains why the change matters and how it will affect the employment report slated to come out February 7.\n",
      "In December, the U.S. Census Bureau released new estimates of the population since 2020. With this Vintage 2024 series, Census revised its estimates of the all-ages civilian non-institutionalized population (CNIP) upward for each year from 2021 through 2024 (see figure 1). The revision was more substantial than is typical, reflecting the unanticipated immigration surge over the past few years and new Census methods of accounting for that surge. As is true for every new vintage, the Census numbers also project population through the end of the following year, so Vintage 2024 includes a projection through December 2025.\n",
      "The projections for population from January to December 2025 will indirectly affect official estimates of labor force and employment that will show up in the February 7 jobs report and subsequent reports throughout the year.   \n",
      "Here’s why: The labor force, the number of employed people, and the number of unemployed people are all computed using the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is a monthly survey of households. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) surveys about 60,000 households each month and then extrapolates by weighting each response to produce aggregate statistics. That extrapolation method relies on estimates of the civilian non-institutionalized population ages 16+ (CNIP 16+). To arrive at those estimates, BLS matches pre-determined aggregate population levels known as population controls, which come from the annually released Census vintages. For example, the 2024 labor force and employment numbers are based on Vintage 2023 population estimates from Census released in December 2023; the newly released Vintage 2024 Census population numbers will in turn be used as population controls throughout calendar year 2025.\n",
      "Importantly, the household survey will not revise CNIP 16+ back before 2025. As shown in figure 2, the published series of CNIP 16+ regularly shows an upward or downward jump in January, reflecting the new vintage projections used in each calendar year. That is, January 2024 through December 2024 will continue to be based on Vintage 2023, January 2023 through December 2023 will be based on Vintage 2022, and so on.  Economic observers generally should be careful about interpreting monthly changes between December and January, particularly changes in aggregate statistics like the size of the population or labor force.1 \n",
      "We know that there will be a jump in the CNIP 16+ estimate for January 2025 stemming from the revised Census population. We don’t yet know the exact size of the jump because the Census has so far only publicly released all-ages CNIP for the latest vintage, not CNIP 16+. But we can make an educated guess using the monthly share of total CNIP that is CNIP 16+ from the Census Vintage 2023 series. We assume the January 2025 share is the same as the published Vintage 2023 December 2024 share.\n",
      "We expect that the January 2025 jump will be larger than usual, reflecting the unusually large adjustment in all-ages population between Vintage 2024 and Vintage 2023. The expected jump in CNIP 16+ is shown in figure 3, with January 2025 CNIP 16+ value for “Current Population Survey” equaling our estimate of CNIP 16+ from Vintage 2024. The CNIP 16+ jump that appears in the employment report between December and January may be somewhat larger or smaller than the 3 million shown here if, in addition to revising total population, Census changes its estimated share of the population across age groups. The January 2025 jump should be interpreted as a statistical artifact, not as a large monthly change in population, labor force, or employment.\n",
      "The Congressional Budget Office also publishes population estimates and estimates of annual net migration. In January 2024, CBO estimated a large flow of immigrants in 2022 and 2023, resulting in much larger population growth than they had previously projected and larger than was evident in the 2023 and 2024 CPS (based on Census Vintage 2022 and Vintage 2023 numbers). We have argued elsewhere that the case for these high immigration flows was well supported and that accounting for those flows helped resolve some labor market puzzles.\n",
      "The January 2025 CBO estimates show somewhat lower immigration flows for 2024 than were previously projected, largely reflecting summer 2024 policies that significantly reduced entries of its “other foreign nationals” category at the border. It is not possible to directly compare CBO and Census net migration estimates because Census publishes annual estimates of total net immigration from July of the prior year through June of the current year, whereas CBO produces calendar year estimates. To convert Census estimates into calendar years, we rely on Census monthly population estimates and assume that the share of population growth attributable within each month to migration is the same as the annual share.\n",
      "For both CBO and Census, we then apply a constant ratio of 81 percent of the CNIP 16+ population to total population based on pre-revision household data among recent immigrants. Figure 4 shows that the upward revision Census made to its net migration estimate brings it much closer to CBO’s estimates, though CBO is still somewhat higher.\n",
      "Figure 5 compares estimates of the cumulative growth in CNIP 16+ for January 2010 through January 2025 from three series: CBO 2025 demographic projections, a series implied by Census Vintage 2024, and a series expected to be published by BLS with the monthly jobs report. The series from CBO is the agency’s population estimates described as “Census through 2020 plus CBO projection.” In January 2023 and January 2024, there is a significant discrepancy between CBO’s estimates and published CNIP 16+ in cumulative growth stemming from divergent immigration assumptions. In January 2025, with the release of Vintage 2024, those two series will be much closer together. As figure 3 and figure 5 show, the published estimates of CNIP 16+ will likely show an increase from January 2024 to January 2025 of roughly 5 million (whereas consistent population series would suggest 3 million) and from December 2024 to January 2025 of roughly 3 million (whereas consistent series would suggest 100,000).\n",
      "The Current Population Survey is also used to produce separate estimates of CNIP 16+, the labor force, and employment for the U.S.-born and foreign-born populations. The Census population controls do not directly specify the number of U.S.-born and foreign-born people; these are estimated using the CPS survey question about place of birth. The foreign-born share is indirectly affected by the Census population controls, however, because the survey weights are based on demographic factors somewhat correlated with foreign-born status, like age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. The CPS estimates for January 2025 will be consistent with Vintage 2024 Census population by demographic group, and though the estimates with demographic detail are not publicly available yet, there could be changes that affect the estimated foreign-born share.  We anticipate that the share of the population that is foreign-born may increase slightly due to the Vintage 2024 revision, but it is unlikely to change abruptly.  \n",
      "It might be helpful to think of the U.S. population as a pie. Survey data show that the U.S.-born share of the pie has been getting smaller over the past few years with high levels of immigration and low fertility rates. At the same time, the previous Census population estimates suggested the pie was only getting slightly larger over that period. A smaller slice and only slightly bigger pie meant that the size of the U.S.-born population was estimated to have declined from January 2023 to January 2024. The apparent decline was at odds with other evidence that there were more U.S.-born people turning 16 than there were deaths. Now, with the new Census revision, we see the overall pie is growing bigger over time, more than Census previously estimated. We expect, therefore, that the U.S.-born CNIP 16+ will rise sharply from December 2024 to January 2025 in published data.\n",
      "The red line in figure 6 shows our estimate of the cumulative increase in U.S. born CNIP 16+ since 2020 as implied by Vintage 2024. To compute U.S.-born CNIP 16+, we estimate total CNIP 16+ as in figure 5, and we apply the share of the 16+ population that is U.S. born from the published monthly CPS data, using the December 2024 CPS share for January 2025.  We expect the published data to show a jump in the U.S.-born civilian noninstitutionalized population of 3.2 million between January 2024 and January 2025.\n",
      "Figure 6 plots annual estimates in order to include estimates implied by CBO’s series “Census through 2020 plus CBO projection.” We can compute monthly estimates for Vintage 2024 and published CPS data. For the change in the U.S.-born CNIP 16+ population between December 2024 and January 2025, we estimate that the consistent Vintage 2024 series implies an increase of 95,000 while the published data will show a much larger 2.4 million.\n",
      "Similarly, the Vintage 2024 estimates will imply a higher foreign-born population in January 2025, as shown in figure 7 (estimated as above using the December 2024 CPS foreign-born share for January 2025). For the change in the foreign-born CNIP 16+ between December 2024 and January 2025, we estimate that Vintage 2024 implies an increase of 21,000 while the published data will show 530,000.\n",
      "Our conclusion is that, because they are based on meaningfully different Census Vintages, extreme caution should be exercised when using the published CPS data to measure month-to-month changes in the size of the population, labor force, or employment since 2021. In particular, the monthly changes in those series from December 2024 to January 2025 reflect the shift to a new Vintage rather than actual developments over that period.\n",
      "Alternatively, there are two time-consistent measures of population: First there are the CBO estimates published in their 2025 demographic projections, titled “Census through 2020 plus CBO projection.” Those are available for CNIP 16+ and available on an annual basis. Second there are the Vintage 2024 estimates published by Census. Those are currently only available for CNIP all ages but are available monthly. The Vintage 2024 estimates incorporate less net migration between 2021 and 2024 than the CBO estimates. While in previous work we argued that the Census Vintage 2023 estimates were clearly too low, our assessment is that both CBO and the revised Census Vintage 2024 series are in the range of reasonable estimates. Differences between Vintage 2024 and CBO are small relative to the remaining uncertainty around immigration flows.\n",
      "Using a time-consistent population measure, it is then reasonable to apply the labor force participation rates, the employment-to-population ratio, and other shares published in the Current Population Survey to compute the size of the labor force, employment, and other measures. We appreciate that those CPS-derived shares may be somewhat sensitive to changing demographic distributions in the population controls. Nonetheless, they are more comparable across changing vintages than the population levels.\n",
      "We next turn to what the most recent population estimates imply for growth in the labor force. We use our estimates of CNIP 16+ from figure 5 and the monthly published estimates for the labor force participation rate, assuming that this rate stays constant from December 2024 to January 2025. Figure 8 shows that the published CPS data will likely show a significant increase in the size of the labor force from January 2024 to January 2025, as the published data for January 2025 align with the Vintage 2024 data, while that for January 2024 aligns with the Vintage 2023 data. In contrast, if the Vintage 2024 data were applied to both January 2024 and 2025 estimates, it would likely imply a more modest increase, as would the CBO time-consistent population series.\n",
      "For example, the published CPS will likely show labor force growth between December 2024 and January 2025—a single month—of roughly 1.8 million because of the change between Vintage 2023 (December) and Vintage 2024 (January). If both months were consistent with Vintage 2024, the growth in the labor force over that one month would likely be closer to 70,000. The labor force growth between January 2024 and January 2025 will be approximately 3 million, but the labor force growth implied by a time-consistent series would be something like 1.5 to 2 million.\n",
      "The new published CPS estimates will likely also imply faster growth in recent months in employment, both overall and separately for U.S.-born and foreign-born adults. We apply our estimates of CNIP 16+ to the monthly published estimates for the employment-to-population ratio for both groups, assuming that this ratio stays constant from December 2024 to January 2025.\n",
      "Figure 9 shows employment in January from 2020 to 2025 for U.S.-born CNIP 16+. Using our preferred population measure from Vintage 2024 or CBO throughout, rather than the switch in vintages used in the soon-to-be-published CPS estimates, would imply more modest growth from January 2024 to January 2025 (and faster growth during 2023). For the change in the U.S.-born CNIP 16+ employment between December 2024 and January 2025, we estimate that Vintage 2024 implies an increase of 55,000 while the published data will show a much larger 1.4 million.\n",
      "Figure 10 shows the same estimates for the foreign-born population. Here, the growth in the published data should be much smaller because only about 18 percent of the total increase in the population is attributed to the foreign-born population (in line with the recent foreign-born share measured in the CPS) when the Vintage 2024 estimates are incorporated in the published CPS data. For the change in the foreign-born CNIP 16+ employment between December 2024 and January 2025, we estimate that Vintage 2024 implies an increase of 13,000 while the published data will show an increase of 340,000.\n",
      "Consistent with the approach we used in earlier analyses, we estimate that recent net migration had a significant effect on labor force and employment growth. Figure 11 uses data from the American Community Survey to show labor force participation for all recent immigrants age 16 and up. For each year since 2016, about half of new arrivals report being in the labor force in the year they arrive. Each cohort shows increasing connection to the labor force over time. Using these trends to estimate labor force participation for those in the recent immigration surge, we find the surge significantly boosts the pace that employment could grow each month without spurring unwanted inflation. CBO’s latest net migration estimates suggest that the pace in potential employment growth was boosted by roughly 100,000 a month in 2023 and 75,000 a month in 2024, while the latest Census Vintage 2024 estimates suggest the boost was about 70,000 and 55,000 monthly in 2023 and 2024, respectively.2\n",
      "The new administration has entered office with a clear desire to reduce the number of immigrants and has already taken action to reduce border flows, ramp up deportations, and make legal migration harder. We anticipate a significant slowdown in net migration over the coming year. It is possible net migration could even turn negative if the administration’s policies are sufficiently extreme. Because immigrants make up the bulk of population growth in the U.S., the anticipated slowdown will drive notably slower population growth, and therefore labor force and employment growth, over 2025. In other words, more modest job growth than in recent years will be consistent with a healthy labor market as well as low and stable inflation.\n",
      "The slowdown also may complicate interpreting data on labor force and employment levels during 2025. Census has already produced its (Vintage 2024) projections that will be used to determine CPS population controls throughout 2025. Assuming the share of the population change attributable to net migration in the coming year is equal to the average share from July 2023 to June 2024, we estimate that those projections are consistent with net migration of around 1.3 million non-institutionalized adults over the course of 2025, lower than we have seen in the past few years but higher than historical norms and higher than we anticipate under the Trump administration. Indeed, in the scenario we estimate with 430,000 interior removals, 900,000 adjudications of parole or asylum leading to removals, and 220,000 people voluntarily outmigrating in response to stricter enforcement, we estimate negative total net migration of 650,000 in 2025 (the corresponding decrease of 530,000 in CNIP net migration is shown by the gray bar in figure 12.) In this scenario, CPS data published during 2025 will likely overstate growth in the true level of population, labor supply, and employment throughout the year.\n",
      "In our previous work, we explored the differences between measures of employment in the CPS and in the Establishment Survey, which reflects what firms report. After adjusting the CPS measure so that it reflects a similar concept as the Establishment Survey, the published estimates of employment in the CPS have been lower by increasing amounts since 2022. In December 2024, the gap between employment in the Establishment Survey and the CPS was a remarkably large 4.3 million.\n",
      "The incorporation of Vintage 2024 will help to shrink that gap. Our rough estimate is that using the Vintage 2024 estimates boosts the level of the CNIP 16+ population in January 2025 by about 2.9 million. That means it boosts the estimate measure of employment in the CPS by about 1.7 million.\n",
      "To add another wrinkle, the employment report on February 7 will also incorporate into the Establishment Survey new data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. As economist Jed Kolko explains, incorporating that new data will revise down employment in the Establishment Survey—perhaps by roughly 800,000.\n",
      "Taken together, the gap between employment in the two surveys—after adjusting employment measures to be comparable—will be a smaller 1.9 million. Notably, if instead we use population and employment implied by the time-consistent CBO series instead of CPS, the gap with employment in the Establishment Survey is roughly 500,000, which is much less remarkable relative to the historical gap.\n",
      "Rapid and unexpected changes in population make the estimation of official population measures incredibly challenging. Recent improvements in the Census population estimates make those official counts align more closely with outside estimates, including those from the Congressional Budget Office. Nonetheless, extreme caution should be exercised when using the published CPS data to measure month-to-month changes in the size of the population, labor force, or employment since 2021. In particular, the monthly changes in those series from December 2024 to January 2025 mainly reflect the shift to a new vintage rather than actual economic developments over that period.\n",

      "TITLE: The CFTC shouldn’t join the Super Bowl party\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "Want to bet on whether the Kansas City Chiefs will beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl? You can now buy or sell a “contract” as to whether they will. It’s called “sports trading,” not “sports betting,” and it is technically a commodity futures contract regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n",
      "How did we get here? When the United States first started regulating commodity futures, only grains like wheat were covered. Regulation was deemed necessary because futures contracts affected the underlying commodity market. Farmers could hedge their exposure to price decreases, and flour mills could hedge their exposure to price increases, by trading those contracts.\n",
      "The definition of commodities—and the CFTC’s jurisdiction—was gradually expanded to keep up with market innovations in financial futures, by including interest rates, currency exchange rates and other economic measures. To be comprehensive, Congress expanded the definition to include “an occurrence…or contingency…that is beyond the control of the parties to the relevant contract…and associated with a financial, commercial, or economic consequence.”\n",
      "That’s pretty broad, but until recently, so-called “event contracts” were mostly about things like weather, corporate mergers, insurance losses or other events where market participants sought to hedge their economic exposure to uncertainty. The CFTC allowed a couple of contracts on elections over the years but only in narrowly constrained environments. When I was chairman, the staff approved an election contract market if it remained in an academic, not-for-profit setting, and subject to restrictions on size and numbers of participants. Over time, however, the operators ignored all those restrictions. \n",
      "In the last couple years, there has been a dramatic expansion of “prediction markets,” in the U.S. and abroad. They trade all sorts of contracts—like what songs will Kendrick Lamar sing at the Super Bowl or what will the Rotten Tomatoes rating be for the latest Captain America movie? Their websites make it easy to trade, typically at modest cost. \n",
      "This expansion of activity has created a regulatory headache for the CFTC. The law says the CFTC can prohibit contracts that involve specific categories such as war, terrorism, unlawful activity or gaming that aren’t “in the public interest.” But when the CFTC relied on that language to prevent the trading of contracts on whether Republicans or Democrats would control Congress in the 2024 election, it lost. The courts said the contracts didn’t constitute gaming or anything unlawful.    \n",
      "So why not just let them be? Many say they generate useful information about consumer preferences and expectations—and were better at predicting the outcome of the 2024 election than most polls. They also argue the risks of fraud and manipulation that typically exist with financial markets are far less present here. With some contracts, at least, there is a risk that people who can influence the outcome of a contract are trading that contract. The platforms can and do seek to prohibit that, but it is doubtful how well those prohibitions are enforced. \n",
      "The Trump administration appears to favor letting these markets expand. The acting chair of the CFTC opposed a rule that was proposed last year that would have limited this activity. And Donald Trump, Jr., has become an advisor to one of the main platforms. \n",
      "My own view is that the CFTC should not be the regulator of these markets. The agency is small and has plenty already on its plate, and it may soon get additional responsibility for the crypto markets. Moreover, this is too far afield from its core competencies. Most of these contracts aren’t about hedging economic exposure or price discovery of an underlying commodity, and the platforms certainly aren’t systemically important to our financial system like the derivatives clearinghouses overseen by the CFTC. \n",
      "Instead of the CFTC, we could follow the United Kingdom and delegate oversight to a national Gambling Commission, perhaps modeled after state gaming commissions. Give it the authority to impose some basic rules, like age restrictions, price limits, and whether certain subjects are off limits, and prohibitions on trading for persons with interests in the contract. Of course, distinguishing which contracts should remain regulated by the CFTC because of their economic purpose—like those related to weather or economic measures—and which ones should not can be challenging, but line drawing is what lawyers are good at. \n",
      "The point is these really aren’t financial institutions. The platforms may call what they offer “trading” and not “betting,” but the activity has a lot more similarity to the latter than it does to commodity futures trading.           \n",

      "TITLE: Trump’s 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will be a blow to all 3 economies\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "The trading relationship between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada is the most important set of trade relations for all three countries. Canada and Mexico are the United States’ first and second largest export markets with goods exports of $680 billion in 2023, and the U.S. is the largest export market for Canada and Mexico. Exports among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada support over 17 million jobs.\n",
      "The trading relationship among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico is underpinned by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a new trade agreement that replaced NAFTA and was negotiated and finalized during the first Trump administration. Yet, on February 1, 2025, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs (which were subsequently delayed by one month) on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on energy imports from Canada to address flows of fentanyl and illegal migration. Mexico and Canada have indicated they are preparing retaliatory tariffs, and Trump has stated that he will raise U.S. tariffs further in response. The difference in the negative economic impact from the current 10% tariff on energy imports versus a 25% tariff is relatively small. And given that Canada and Mexico look almost certain to retaliate, likely leading to even higher U.S. tariffs, the following assesses the impact of across-the-board 25% tariffs.\n",
      "The impact of these tariffs on trade across North America will be particularly impactful, not only because of the large volume of trade that is involved, but also because of the importance of supply chains, which comprise around 50% of intraregional trade. For example, in the production of a Chevy Silverado or Dodge Challenger, components cross borders multiple times before being assembled into a final product. As a result, imposing a 25% tariff every time a product crosses borders adds up quickly.\n",
      "The following presents the results of simulations based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model under two scenarios. The first scenario assesses the economic impacts on the U.S., Mexico, and Canada with the U.S. imposing across-the-board 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada with no retaliation from Canada or Mexico. The second scenario assesses the impact of Canada and Mexico retaliating with 25% tariffs on U.S. imports. All economic impacts are estimated to occur over the medium term (i.e., over the next three to five years). Given that U.S. tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada under USMCA are in most cases close to zero now, a 25% tariff will have significant negative economic shocks for the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. In both scenarios, the economic impact is more severe for Mexico and Canada because a much larger share of their trade is with the U.S.—83% of Mexico’s exports and 78% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S., whereas around one-third of U.S. exports are destined for Canada and Mexico. That said, the economic hit to the U.S. is substantial, with some sectors in particular standing to contract significantly.\n",
      "These tariffs will also harm the Trump administration’s goal of developing more secure supply chains and competing with China. Continuing to make progress here will require greater trade and investment across North America to strengthen and diversify existing supply chains and reduce reliance on China-centered supply chains. The tariffs are directly at odds with deeper economic integration across North America. In fact, China will benefit from a trade war across North America, as it undercuts efforts to reshore supply chains away from China. More broadly, because these tariffs are most likely inconsistent with USMCA, they signal to the world that any international agreement with the U.S. is not worth all that much, raising difficult questions for all U.S. allies and trading partners about the value of trade agreements with the U.S. One result is that countries will start to hedge—creating new options for trade and investment to insure against an unreliable U.S., which will include being more open to expanding trade and investment relations with China.\n",
      "Figure 1 shows that tariffs would reduce U.S. GDP growth by around 0.25 percentage points, and with retaliation, U.S. GDP growth falls over 0.3 percentage points. With U.S. GDP in 2024 of approximately $23.5 trillion, this amounts to an estimated loss of U.S. economic output over the medium term of around $45 billion from the 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and this rises to about $75 billion in lost economic output should Canada and Mexico retaliate. As can be seen, losses to economic growth for Canada and Mexico are around 1.15 percentage points from the 25% U.S. tariffs, and this increases to over 3 percentage points should they both impose 25% tariffs on U.S. imports.\n",
      "The tariffs will take a toll on employment in all three countries. Figure 2 shows the job losses from tariffs. In the U.S., employment will decline by 0.11% from the 25% tariffs on imports and rise to a 0.25% loss of jobs with retaliation. Based on 2024 job data, this is equivalent to over 177,000 job losses from the 25% tariff, rising to over 400,000 job losses in the event Canada and Mexico retaliate. Job losses in Canada and Mexico would be around 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively, and based on 2024 jobs numbers, this would amount to 278,000 Canadian jobs and 1.4 million Mexican jobs. In the event of retaliation, job loses would increase to almost 2.5% and 3.6% of total employment in Canada and Mexico, equivalent to over 510,000 Canadian jobs and 2.2 million Mexican jobs.\n",
      "Tariffs will also lead to lower wages across the three countries. In the U.S., wages would decline by 0.2%, and by 0.5% in the event of retaliation. In Canada, wages would fall by over 2.6% and in Mexico by over 4.5% in the scenario of no retaliation, and by 4.9% and over 7% in Canada and Mexico following retaliation by both countries. Worth noting here is that the contraction in demand for labor and decline in wages would be distributed evenly across skilled and unskilled labor, but with a slightly higher impact on unskilled labor.\n",
      "The impact from tariffs on exports shown in Figure 3 would also be large. U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico would decline by around 6% from a 25% U.S. tariff, and 9% in the case of retaliation. Exports from Canada to the U.S. and Mexico would contract by 9% with a U.S. tariff, and by 19% with retaliatory tariffs. Mexico’s exports would contract by close to 14% and over 25% with retaliatory tariffs. \n",
      "As seen in Figure 4, tariffs would also have an impact on inflation. The tariffs would cause inflation to rise in the U.S. by over 1.3 percentage points. With retaliation, the inflation increase in the U.S. would be less at around 0.8 percentage points, but still significant, reflecting the greater slowdown in U.S. economic growth. In the case of Canada, inflation would decline as U.S. tariffs lower economic growth, but should Canada then impose 25% tariffs, inflation would increase, reflecting the impact on the price of imports from the U.S. In the case of Mexico, there is also significant decline in inflation of 9% following U.S. tariffs, reflecting the impact of lower economic growth, and this decline is reduced to around 6 percentage points should Mexico put a 25% tariff on U.S. imports.\n",
      "The results presented earlier show the impact on the aggregate economies. The negative impact on exports is widely dispersed across sectors, the bottom line being that all three countries experience significant sector-wide contractions in exports.\n",
      "The following presents some of the sector-specific trade results. Given that there are no tariffs proposed between Canada and Mexico, and as the vast majority of their exports are to the U.S., the following analysis focuses on the impacts on U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico, and the impacts on Canadian and Mexican exports to the U.S. To start, the trinational integration of many of the sectors through supply chains means that many of the sectors affected by these tariffs are common across the three countries. Moreover, many of the sectors affected produce manufacturing and other business inputs, such as metals, computers, and machinery equipment. Raising the costs of these exports will therefore increase costs for businesses in all countries, reducing their competitiveness, and lead many businesses to instead source inputs from other countries, including those in Asia.\n",
      "In the U.S. for example, as shown in Table 1, exports across mining, manufacturing, lumber, and metals would all suffer large contractions in exports. U.S. mining exports to Canada suffer an almost 60% decline in exports, and following retaliation, U.S. mining exports are almost completely wiped out, with a 97% contraction. There is a 25% contraction in U.S. motor vehicle exports to Canada that increases to 55% with retaliation, and products in “other transport” fall by 18% following U.S. tariffs and by 79% with retaliation. In the electrical equipment sector, the 12% decline in exports from the electrical sector will turn into a 30% plus decline with retaliation. \n",
      "Table 2 shows that U.S. exports to Mexico also fall across manufacturing, lumber, foods, and metals in particular, but almost every sector experiences a large contraction in exports. For example, U.S. exports of nonferrous metals such as copper, aluminum, zinc, and gold decline by 35% following the U.S. tariffs and then by 78% with retaliation by Mexico. U.S. exports of manufactured products—computers and electronics, motor vehicles, electronic equipment, other transport—all suffer large declines. For example, there is a 31% decline in exports of computers and electronics, and with retaliation, these U.S. exports fall by over 80%. Exports of motor vehicles also decline by 23% with tariffs and then by 65% following retaliation.\n",
      "Table 3 shows some of the key sectors where Canada’s exports to the U.S. would contract across manufacturing, mining, textiles, rubber, and plastics. For example, exports of electronic equipment and electronics decline by over 70% following U.S. tariffs and by close to 80% with retaliatory tariffs. Exports of “other transport” decline by 70% with tariffs and 74% with retaliation, and motor vehicle exports from Canada decline by 53% with the U.S. tariffs and by 68% with retaliatory tariffs.\n",
      "The decline in exports from Mexico are across mining, the auto sector, electrical equipment, rubber and apparel, and textiles. For instance, Mexico’s mining sector exports suffer contractions of over 90%. The pharmaceutical sector also contracts over 60% with tariffs and over 70% following retaliation. Mexico’s exports of motor vehicle and electronic equipment sectors also contract significantly, a common outcome for all three countries given the supply chains in these sectors, with exports falling 40% and 55%, respectively, and with the retaliation, exports of these products fall by 50% and 62%.\n",
      "The U.S. tariff of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico is going to reduce U.S. economic growth, reduce jobs, cause wages to fall, and prices to rise, and retaliation by Canada and Mexico will multiply the economic harms across the three countries. President Trump has said that these tariffs are in response to flows of fentanyl and illegal immigrants from Mexico and Canada. The problem with these tariffs is that they impose immediate costs on U.S. consumers, workers, and businesses without a clear link between these tariffs and how they will reduce flows of immigrants or fentanyl.\n",
      "Moreover, these tariffs will harm the Trump administration’s goal of developing more secure supply chains and competing with China. More broadly, because these tariffs are most likely inconsistent with USMCA, countries will start to hedge—creating new options for trade and investment to insure against an unreliable U.S., which will include being more open to expanding trade and investment relations with China. \n",
      "Unless the Trump administration resolves its issues with Canada and Mexico and unwinds these tariffs quickly, the economic, diplomatic, and strategic harms from the tariffs will be substantial.\n",

      "TITLE: Ecuador’s elections, organized crime, and security challenges\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "As Ecuadorians head to the polls on February 9 to elect the country’s president and national assembly members, security and criminal violence have overshadowed other issues, including the ongoing energy and unemployment crises. Once considered an “island of peace” escaping criminal violence, Ecuador has seen homicides surge by 430% over the past five years, femicides double, youth violence skyrocket by 640%, and extortion explode. The insecurity is debilitating to the lives of the Ecuadorian people. Ecuador’s rising crime also affects the United States by empowering dangerous criminal groups and exacerbating migration flows. Indeed, during his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Marco Rubio highlighted Ecuador as a U.S. priority, particularly in addressing security threats and combating Chinese illegal fishing.\n",
      "After brazen criminal attacks in Guayaquil in early 2024, President Daniel Noboa, of the National Democratic Action (AND) party, declared an “internal armed conflict” and labeled 22 criminal groups as terrorist organizations. Issuing a state of emergency, he sent the military to take them on and placed prisons under military control while seeking to decapitate the groups’ leadership. An April 2024 referendum solidified “mano dura” (iron-fist) policies and the military’s role in public security. Over the course of the year, homicides fell by 16.5%, an important accomplishment. But the government’s security strategy has been incomplete, and its high-value targeting (HVT) has also created a perfect storm for violence to increase or persist. The criminal groups’ domestic and international ambitions and scope of activities have expanded. A holistic security strategy is needed. It must move beyond HVT to systematically dismantle the criminal groups’ operational structures, strengthen the judicial system, and bolster police and investigative capacities.\n",
      "Amid widespread criticism of the military’s human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary and mass detentions, and systemic impunity as well as inhumane prison conditions, the government’s “Plan Fénix” succeeded in capturing some crime bosses. Others were isolated in prison, while some fled abroad. Such HVT is politically appealing and relatively easy to execute.\n",
      "However, as in many HVT plans around the world, it left the middle operational structures unaffected. Just like in Mexico, mid-level commanders in Ecuador have been vying for control, while the country’s criminal groups have splintered, including the four largest—Los Lobos, Los Choneros, Los Tiguerones, and the Latin Kings. The larger number of violent actors and within-group succession power struggles make mounting effective responses far more challenging. And violence has spread into new areas of Ecuador, further straining security responses.\n",
      "For example, in the town of Durán, a cocaine transshipment hub, turf wars between Los Chone Killers, a splinter faction of Los Choneros, and the Latin Kings included car bombings targeting public officials. In Manabí, government operations against Los Choneros led to the formation of violent splinter groups, Los Pepes—a coalition of eight smaller gangs. The conflict between these groups has caused widespread violence against civilians.\n",
      "As has been the case with criminal groups from Mexico to Colombia and beyond, Ecuador’s criminal groups have diversified beyond drug trafficking into extortion, kidnapping, illegal mining, human smuggling, fuel trafficking, and wildlife trafficking.\n",
      "In areas controlled by Los Choneros, Tiguerones, and Los Lobos, violence-underpinned extortion taxes affect businesses, government institutions, as well as ordinary people. Small and medium-sized businesses struggle to pay and are sometimes forced to shut down. These “vacunas,” fees a victim must pay to avoid physical harm or property damage, are a form of governance and control, not just profit. Similarly, illegal mining, dominated by Los Lobos and Los Choneros, brings more than top dollars: it facilitates money laundering and networking with transnational crime groups.\n",
      "In fact, the government’s targeting policy also inadvertently diversified arrangements between transnational and Ecuadorian crime groups. Previously, powerful international groups like the Sinaloa Cartel and Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG) relied on a favored Ecuadorian counterpart for cocaine shipments and other operations in Ecuador: for Sinaloa, Los Choneros; for CJNG, Los Lobos. In their violent bipolar rivalry spanning from Mexico through Chile, the Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) pushed these local groups into turf wars. However, HVT and the resulting fragmentation of Ecuador’s criminal groups led the transnational groups to stop relying on a single local group in Ecuador; now, they make short-term deals with many local groups instead. On the one hand, this could reduce the power of some Ecuadorian groups because they are no longer individually benefiting from the Mexican groups’ exclusive support. But on the other hand, it could amplify violent competition among the Ecuadorian groups as each seeks to secure a contract with the big transnational DTOs, which are themselves trying to prevent the Ecuadorian groups from signing up with their rival.\n",
      "However, the local groups are no longer satisfied with being just vassals and lesser partners of the transnational DTOs. Los Lobos, for example, has grown from merely being service providers for the CJNG and Albanian and ex-FARC mafias into themselves bypassing intermediaries and controlling cocaine shipments to Europe. Ecuadorian crime groups’ international ambitions are threatening the turfs of transnational DTOs, raising the risk of violence escalation.\n",
      "Most deleteriously, criminal groups in Ecuador increasingly use violence and corruption to embed themselves in politics. Assassinations of political candidates who challenge criminal groups have surged. In Durán, criminal organizations have coerced officials into providing them with protection and directly took over local governance structures. The state’s authority and legitimacy have weakened, while parallel criminal governance structures are expanding.\n",
      "Cases like the Metastasis scandal have exposed deep ties between government officials and organized crime.\n",
      "Yet the country’s weak justice system remains plagued by corruption, inefficiency, and intimidation. Since 2022, 15 judges and prosecutors have been murdered.\n",
      "Still, President Noboa’s mano-dura policies have served him well politically, bolstering his nearly 55% approval rating. In a January 24 poll, he led among the 14 presidential candidates with 36.9%, ahead of Luisa González of the Citizen Revolution Movement tallying 32.4%. While enjoying  44% personal approval ratings, González must navigate the polarizing legacy of her party leader, former President Rafael Correa, who is accused of corruption and is in exile. (If no candidate secures over 50% of the vote, or 40% with a 10-point lead, a runoff will occur on April 13.)\n",
      "Noboa’s platform promises to cement the use of a joint police-military force he created and increase the use of cyber tools and big data.\n",
      "González also favors technological tools to combat crime. But in contrast to Noboa, she offers a victim-centered, rights-based approach that prioritizes social reintegration for incarcerated individuals and reestablishing community safety assemblies to enable collaborative policing. She neither mentions the armed forces nor specific measures to address escalating violence. Rather, she talks of rebuilding trust in the police and its capacity by providing free preparation for entrance tests for police academy aspirants.\n",
      "To further reduce violence and roll back the power of criminal groups, a security strategy that combines law enforcement with measures to build societal resilience against organized crime is required. This includes well-designed and diligently evaluated anti-crime socio-economic programs.\n",
      "Shifting from HVT toward dismantling criminal networks’ middle operational level is critical. This approach weakens the groups’ operational capacity, disrupts leadership regeneration, and generates actionable evidence against top-tier criminals. To minimize the risk of escalation, careful strategic planning should guide operations, force prepositioning, and sequencing.\n",
      "Expanding law enforcement’s focus beyond cocaine trafficking to illegal mining, extortion, and human, weapons, and wildlife trafficking is also important to gather intelligence and deprive polycrime groups of crucial funding and political influence.\n",
      "Quick progress can be made in this broader effort by investing in scanning and inspection technologies and strengthening interagency and international cooperation at ports and borders, where at least 68% of Ecuador’s exports are at risk of containing contraband. Yet it will be much more difficult, though essential, to combat illegal mining, logging, and poaching in situ, where a combination of law enforcement and socio-economic support to communities is needed.\n",
      "Bolstering Ecuador’s judicial system by purging corruption and strengthening independence is fundamental. The reestablishment of the Ministry of Justice, dismantled in 2018, would help coordinate criminal policy and institutional oversight. Creating special investigative units, perhaps with U.S. assistance, and insulating them from political interference would advance efforts to tackle high-level corruption and powerful criminal networks.\n",
      "The $7.6 million that the United States is sending to help Ecuador combat illegal mining and modernize port security and Ecuador’s recent authorization for temporary U.S. military operations in the Galápagos Islands provide a useful start for countering drug trafficking and maritime crime. Enhancing U.S. Coast Guard collaboration with Ecuadorian counterparts is equally important. These law enforcement efforts need to be combined with consultations with local communities and civil society to mitigate concerns about environmental impacts on the Galápagos and avoid repeating the controversies surrounding the former U.S. base in Manta.\n",
      "Efforts to comprehensively dismantle wildlife trafficking operations and networks, especially those with ties to China, should also focus on terrestrial species. Targeting wildlife trafficking operations often yields intelligence on many other illegal operations and connections to rival state powers. But once again, law enforcement actions need to be combined with diligent respect for human rights and socio-economic assistance to wean communities of economic dependence on poaching.\n",
      "Finally, upgrading Ecuador’s security infrastructure should also be a critical priority. The existing ECU-911 digital security system, developed by Chinese companies CEIEC and Huawei, poses significant privacy and accountability risks and could serve as a backdoor to espionage. The United States can support Ecuador in replacing it with secure, internationally compliant surveillance systems to enhance monitoring and prevent criminal activity while safeguarding data integrity.\n",

      "TikTok has become one of the many issues that the Trump administration inherited prior to inauguration. But this is not a new issue for the president. In 2019, Trump addressed the cybersecurity concerns of TikTok when he signed the first executive order elevating them. Five years later, President Biden signed into law a ban on the social media app unless parts of its assets were divested and sold to a U.S. company. Days before Trump’s inauguration, the Chinese company vowed to abide by Biden’s executive order after losing an appeal in the Supreme Court, and in opposition of the law, Trump formally extended the ban 75 days after vowing to do so the day before his inauguration. His actions successfully assuaged the fears of the more than 169 million individual and business users who were worried about their data, including years of video feeds and other content.\n",

      "TITLE: Large Language Models learn to collaborate and reason\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advances in speed, cost efficiency, accuracy, and the capacity to process larger amounts of text over the past year, enabling more advanced use cases. Three developments stand out in recent months:\n",
      "First, new reasoning capabilities, exemplified by OpenAI’s o1 series, are helping to overcome traditional barriers in LLM-based reasoning, enabling AI models to engage in multi-step problem-solving and logical deduction. This advancement opens new avenues for LLM use in research, particularly in areas requiring complex analysis.\n",
      "Second, workspaces for interactive collaboration, such as Copilot, Claude’s Artifacts, and ChatGPT’s Canvas, are changing how we interact with LLMs. These workspaces create an environment where users can iteratively develop and refine ideas, shifting away from static chat-style interactions towards a more dynamic, document-oriented collaboration with AI. They allow users to work in tandem with LLMs, offering real-time feedback and allowing for iterative editing.\n",
      "Third, LLM-powered search, newly integrated into ChatGPT and Gemini, and also offered by startups like Perplexity, is starting to become a useful tool to provide up-to-date answers to questions that are grounded in facts found on the internet, together with the requisite citations—a crucial capability for researchers.\n",
      "The paper demonstrates these advances through dozens of practical examples across seven domains: ideation and feedback, writing, background research, coding, data analysis, mathematical derivations, and—newly added—research promotion. The latter includes innovative use cases in automatically generating blog posts, presentation slides, and even podcasts. \n",
      "Each frontier AI lab has released new models in recent months. Google DeepMind and OpenAI and rank first on a range of LLM benchmarks with updated model versions. Elon Musk’s xAI has shot to the #3 spot. Claude 3.5 Opus excels at writing-related tasks and several other benchmarks. Excellent open-source LLMs from Meta and Alibaba are close in capabilities to the models of the other four labs and offer the greatest level of data security.\n",
      "These developments have significant implications for research, offering unprecedented opportunities for increased productivity. However, they also raise important questions about the future of research methodology and evaluation. As the production of research becomes easier with AI assistance, the bottleneck may shift from generation to assessment of ideas and results. This highlights the need to develop robust methods for evaluating AI-augmented content while ensuring that these powerful tools enhance rather than diminish the quality and impact of our work.\n",

      "TITLE: Is Atlanta’s Cop City the answer to public safety?\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "Police reform is redefining political accountability for local decision-making across America. In Atlanta, the opening of Cop City, an 85-acre policing facility with a $115 million price tag, marks a pivotal moment in the city’s evolving approach to public safety. Officially known as the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, Cop City represents the use of advanced technology in the professionalization of policing. Yet, some view it as a symbol of ignoring community demands to irradicate symbols, actions, and claiming of lands to perpetuate state violence and no investment in social needs. \n",
      "Failed police reform efforts in Atlanta, similar to those in other U.S. cities, erode both the community’s trust and its tolerance for police brutality. Many questions remain unanswered about what is supporting and stifling police reform across the United States. We use Cop City as an example of setbacks to community-driven police reform strategies in the country. We also discuss the implications of how cities should address the social needs of communities as a primary strategy to police reform to mitigate health consequences of police violence for three of the most populous Black cities in the U.S.  \n",
      "The systemic criminalization of communities of color and their exposure to police violence in U.S. cities is well documented. Many urban areas, including New York City, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Baltimore, have been shaped by these forces. Community stakeholders have adopted civil tactics to illustrate that urban infrastructures that once disrupted Black communities are now sites of protest, such as planned highway stoppages. Advocates for police reform have faced antidemocratic actions from Atlanta politicians, who have escalated violence against protesters, responding to environmental activists with riot gear, domestic terrorism charges, and excessive force.\n",
      "As a steadily rising global hub for political activists and sports fanatics alike, Atlanta’s approach to injury prevention prioritizes organized policing over community-centered solutions. Cop City is located on an unincorporated portion of DeKalb County nested between racially segregated communities with stark socioeconomic differences. The placement of Cop City on the historic Old Prison Farm raises questions about local politicians’ awareness of community concerns and histories. Repurposing a former prison farm for advanced police training has drawn criticism as tone-deaf. The site’s location has heightened controversy over the project and attracted opposition from various interest groups.\n",
      "West of Cop City are poorer neighborhoods long stigmatized by the presence of major criminal legal institutions, including the maximum-security Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary and the Georgia Army National Guard. To the north, gentrifying areas like Summerhill, home to a stadium district, enjoy the efficiency of proximity to schools, jobs, and leisure—a benefit granted by generations of early access to wealth. East of Cop City, Black middle-class suburbs such as Decatur reflect political and economic progress born from a bootstrapped ethos of independence. To the south, factories and warehouses support the logistical operations of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Yet, the communities southeast of Cop City tell the paradoxical story of the Weelaunee Forest. It is home to one of Atlanta’s largest remaining green spaces and home to one of its most heterogenous Black communities. While some subdivisions feature sprawling homes and manicured lawns, others tower with trees that conceal byroads where the county’s electrical grid and sewer water treatment facility meet. \n",
      "The four sides of Cop City highlight Atlanta’s complex social landscape, where wealth and disadvantage intersect with racial and class segregation in distinct ways.\n",
      "These communities are not Black suburban ghettos. Rather, they present new strategies Black families are using to secure their own futures. Black youth in Atlanta already face neighborhood deprivation challenges born from underfunded public schools, environmental pollution, and wealth depreciation. The spatial dynamics around Cop City reveal how systemic racism shapes New Urbanism projects, often reinforced through police surveillance. \n",
      "As Cop City was taking shape, we were interviewing stakeholders in Baltimore and St. Louis about police reform efforts. As professors in each of these cities, we recognized the similarities among them as places with large Black populations, high segregation, and public police brutality incidents. In interesting ways, our interviews with community leaders, police officers, and elected officials in Baltimore and St. Louis demonstrate how a facility like Cop City can be antithetical to the goals of reducing police brutality and improving safe environments. A St. Louis stakeholder noted, “Safety isn’t just about policing—it’s about the systems that keep people out of harm’s way. Housing, jobs, health—that’s public safety.” Similarly, a Baltimore stakeholder echoed, “Policing doesn’t operate in a vacuum. It’s tied to every other system that determines how people live—or don’t.” \n",
      "However, some police officers view public safety narrowly, prioritizing law enforcement control to prevent injury. Atlanta’s Cop City approaches public safety through a “broken door” model rather than a public health framework. This mindset contributed to the fatal police response to Rayshard Brooks’ mental health crisis in South Atlanta. Community stakeholders in St. Louis and Baltimore insist that these tactics damage police-community relations by sidelining community engagement. A St. Louis stakeholder expressed frustration, saying, “Public safety starts with housing and mental health, not more police.” A Baltimore stakeholder emphasized, “If you can’t trust the process, you can’t trust the outcome. Communities deserve to know where decisions are coming from.” \n",
      "Granting police greater authority and control over injury prevention excludes communities from decision-making processes around how to redress social conditions that impair well-being. Stakeholders’ comments align with the escalation of unrest over the lack of transparency regarding how Atlanta’s Cop City came to be. Atlanta’s politicians failed to bring the Stop Cop City referendum to the ballot box in November 2024.  \n",
      "Atlanta is not a blueprint for public safety reform. That blueprint will depend on whether local politicians hold themselves accountable for how they invest taxpayer dollars. Atlanta’s City Council has chosen to support internal militarization. The following questions are crucial for advocacy across municipalities:  \n",
      "The suburbanized Black Mecca provides the Atlanta City Council with many ideas for securing community health. For instance, the incorporation of Stonecrest in DeKalb County and South Fulton in Fulton County leverages the secessional politics of the cityhood movement, driven by Black self-governance in racially segregated areas with concentrated extremes of income. The rise of multiethnic leadership in Gwinnett County reveals how coalitional politics can gain traction. Other efforts focus on enhancing institutions, such as the restoration of the Morris Brown College, the City of East Point’s investment in Black entrepreneurship, and the transformation of Fort McPherson (a former Confederate Army Base), by Tyler Perry Studios. These communities offer visions of public safety that do not rely heavily on policing.\n",
      "Overall, communities are calling for solutions to the housing and mental health crises—not a 30-year contract that diverts an additional $36 million in taxpayer funds away from essential resources.\n",

      "BODY:\n",
      "In his first two weeks of office, President Trump signed several Executive Orders (EOs) to fulfill one of his many campaign promises—to reduce the size of the federal government. He has rolled back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, asserting that the federal government will no longer consider race, ethnicity, or other federally protected characteristics in hiring and retention decisions. In recent days, he announced a financial buyout to federal employees who do not wish to comply with the new Return to Office (RTO) mandate, which requires employees to be in an office for five days per week, despite concerns about available office space. The details of the buyout were outlined in an email with the subject line, “Fork in the Road,” sent by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on January 28, 2025, to over 2 million federal workers. The OPM also offered deferred resignation where federal employees could resign immediately and still be paid for the next several months. Meanwhile, those who decide to stay are not promised future employment and the memo stated new conditions for employees, that they be “loyal, trustworthy, and to strive for excellence in their daily work”; principles that likely will become benchmarks for future performance reviews.\n",
      "Under the Trump administration, federal workforce reductions will happen, along with a greater deployment of artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and outsourcing to private firms. These new services will cost millions of dollars to design, deploy, and train the federal workforce, creating new national and data security threats as well, given the level of protected information at stake. But the influence of Big Tech leaders, who are formally and informally advising President Trump and his administration, may be accelerating a smaller government workforce based on their own values about corporate governance. Big Tech companies were among those that led the RTO mandates for their own employees after the pandemic with similar terms and conditions, as well as promises made that were not kept. Many of these same companies are making AI more technically advanced without realizing that millions of people are still impacted in the U.S. by the lack of digital access. As Biden era policies were working to address the connectivity challenges faced throughout the U.S., these programs are now being challenged, which will almost guarantee that even the best of AI technologies embedded in government functions may be inaccessible to most people.\n",
      "Seven months after his acquisition of Twitter, Elon Musk required an immediate RTO of employees, who were promised flexible work arrangements prior to the sale. Twitter was the first company to mandate such policies, resulting in the attrition of 80% of the workforce mainly through termination. Musk is now leading the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), leading the federal workforce reduction efforts, making the actions of the last few days eerily familiar. In 2023, Meta’s RTO mandate required that employees be in the office at least three days per week and threatened workers with termination if they did not oblige. Around the same time, Meta promoted its augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies, suggesting that hybrid employees could utilize the technology. In January, Amazon also joined its peers in requiring that employees be in the office five days per week, which already is leading to traffic congestion in its Seattle headquarters, lack of office space for returning employees, increased theft in open work environments, among other concerns being shared by employees.\n",
      "The intent behind RTO policies to get more employees into the office is legitimate. Five years since the official end of the pandemic and employers are seeking to recreate collaboration and community among more isolated team members. Yet, private companies do not compare to the size of the U.S. federal government. The redundancy and minutia built into certain government jobs are intentional to ensure certain protections against fraud, theft, and most importantly, autocrats.\n",
      "It’s also no secret that many Big Tech work environments offer other perks to employees to keep them in the office longer. From free meals and lunch break massages to exercise rooms, employees who have returned to the office benefit from private sector incentives, including pay. Instead of leaving children, elderly parents, and pets at home, some of these private technology companies allow their employees to bring two out of three loved ones to work by instituting on-site day cares, or “bring your pet to work” policies. These incentives will probably never make it into a federal office, especially as taxpayers foot the bill for government infrastructure.\n",
      "In a 2005 blog on the importance of federalism, the late Brookings scholar, Pietro S. Nivola stated: “For the often indiscriminate preoccupation of national policymakers with the details of local administration is not just wasteful; it can be irresponsible.” But these efforts to reduce the federal workforce also come with actions to modernize it, which ultimately may result in privatization of government services through increasing automation of job roles that will be eviscerated and outsourcing of certain government functions.\n",
      "In the same week of announcing federal furloughs, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Gov, which will allow government agencies who were previously prohibited from using the large language model to access “non-public sensitive data.” In a press release, OpenAI discussed the future integration of AI into government services: “We believe the U.S. government’s adoption of artificial intelligence can boost efficiency and productivity and is crucial for maintaining and enhancing America’s global leadership in technology. This includes making our models available to support public sector work that benefits society–such as public health, energy and the environment, transportation and infrastructure, consumer protection, and national security.”\n",
      "The federal government is no novice when it comes to the integration of AI into existing service delivery models. The Biden administration’s AI EO, recently rescinded by the current administration, directed government agencies to appoint a chief AI officer, identify plans for leveraging AI to improve government functions, and strategies for mitigating online biases, among other national security requirements in software applications. Surprisingly, Big Tech companies were intricately involved in designing this EO with particular emphasis on red-teaming to weed out technical vulnerabilities in applications. But with those AI mandates reversed, the federal government will become a Wild West for the experimentation, testing, and deployment of tools that may have consequential impacts on consumers. Further, settled procurement policies may be upended to get more products to the public sector market sooner.\n",
      "For example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) attempted to revert to make their work more efficient by using AI systems to flag taxpayers for auditing. However, a 2024 independent report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that claims for tax credits were disproportionately disqualifying eligible applicants. A year prior, a Stanford University study found that the IRS’s use of AI was more likely to flag Black taxpayers for unnecessary audits, despite their compliance with the tax code; the agency has since confirmed the report findings and stopped using the model.\n",
      "The design and use of AI by federal agencies in lieu of human federal workers will likely lead to similar biases based on the data training these models, which may be over- or under-represented by populations who rely on government services. Without guidance on the privacy protections for consumers, along with some level of regulatory or legislative oversight, the federal government will become a minefield for exploitation, and in some instances, turn to outsourcing to third-party companies, who have their own precarious history harvesting enormous amounts of personal data.\n",
      "Making the government vulnerable to an industry where data is consistently monetized for economic gain is, at best, a dangerous proposition to all consumers of government services where some communities will be harmed by biased training data, online mistakes in eligibility, and in many instances, the lack of basic internet access to benefit from increased amounts of digital services.\n",
      "Across the U.S., many people lack digital access, especially those living in rural areas, older, or in areas where connectivity is unaffordable or not as robust when compared to more connected communities. Over the past five years, heightened public awareness of the realities of the digital disparities resulted in an increase in available public and private sector resources for states and municipalities to bridge the digital divide. Having internet access is a bipartisan concern because households must have the financial capacity to afford monthly internet services. Yet, advances in lowering the cost of broadband access were overturned when the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) ended in April of 2024, de-enrolling more than 20 million households who were benefitting from being connected after the pandemic. Further, many of these households were in rural, red states where guaranteed internet access finally didn’t compete with other pressing budgetary concerns, like food and transportation. As government leverages existing and emerging technologies to change the way work is performed, consumers will be on the receiving end, and if an individual or household lives in a digital desert, or has insufficient access, the translation and migration from in-person to online service delivery will be lost and potentially a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n",
      "In 2011, my co-author, Jon Gant and I wrote an article about the levels of transparency and infrastructure needed to accomplish this massive feat. At that time, the Obama administration had moved toward an Open Government Directive to assemble more alignment in federal, state, and local resources. In addition to promoting more collaboration between the public and private sectors, one of the most important recommendations was to ensure that every day people could access these digital resources in their home or at local anchor institutions, including libraries, community organizations, and schools.\n",
      "The point here is that no matter how much AI is embedded in improving and recalibrating traditionally analog positions, the consumer is at the center of the production cycle, and without internet access, AI and digital literacy, and greater transparency on how a more modernized government will work, efforts will be less effective. That is why more research and data are required when enacting such changes, and the influence of Big Tech companies, who are looking to government for more profit-incentive than public good, should be questioned.\n",
      "The federal government is massive, and no one would disagree that opportunities to make it leaner are perhaps overdue. Public units need to become more efficient and effective. But changes embedded in the opaqueness of decision-makers, and driven by politically motivated issues are not the way to serve the American consumer of government services; too much is at stake, including taxpayer dollars. Further, policymakers need to be sensitive to the impact of possible changes on the existing workforce who represent the talent pool necessary to maintain order. Doing otherwise can result in widespread disruption, generating chaos and ineffectiveness.\n",

      "BODY:\n",
      "Beginning in 2021 with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and then augmented by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the U.S. Congress adopted a more holistic and well-funded commitment to clean and resilient transportation. Central to that congressional commitment was a direct investment in the capacity of U.S. states to conduct climate-focused transportation planning and construct related projects. Put plainly, federal law induced and supported state action. \n",
      "Now, with a Republican trifecta in power in the federal government, those climate commitments are already under threat from a presidential executive order. What felt like a historic shift could be short-lived. As a result, stakeholders quickly need to understand exactly how the two new laws impact state transportation planning—and how states may respond if federal funding is discontinued. To answer both questions, we inventoried every state’s climate-focused transportation planning practices. \n",
      "The results are both promising and concerning. Aided by direct federal support, more states are now producing emissions mitigation and climate resilience plans. However, the historic record also suggests roughly half of these states may revert to less climate-focused planning if federal support recedes. The record is especially worrisome in the Southeastern and Great Plains states.  \n",
      "Based on these findings, we believe Congress should continue to support climate-focused transportation programming. The planning laws worked; now is the time to fund states to follow-through on those plans. At the same time, states should not rely solely on federal support. Beyond continuing to plan and invest on their own, states would be wise to create a rainy-day capital account that could insure against any reductions in federal fiscal support. And with so much money being invested, states should find more ways to solicit public input on future transportation investments. \n",
      "Over the past few decades, a clear scientific consensus has emerged around the urgent need for a cleaner and more resilient transportation system. The sector is now the country’s largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly due to increasing vehicle miles traveled. Changing weather patterns continue to pound the physical network with rising damages, increased closures, and knock-on costs for households and businesses. Transforming an economic sector this large—one whose public and private assets were valued at $11.1 trillion in 2023—will require significant foresight, planning, and coordination. \n",
      "States will need to take a leading role in such massive planning and investment efforts. Governors, legislators, and their colleagues already have the legal authority to regulate some vehicle emissions standards, the fuels powering their energy system, and the costs to purchase vehicles and access the network. States also manage emergency evacuation routes and work with the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to increase infrastructure resilience and make repairs after damage occurs, especially on the vast state-owned highway network. Just as importantly, states have experience in putting together long-term plans, including wide-ranging climate action plans.  \n",
      "The concern is that not all states bring the same rigor or commitment to environmental-focused transportation planning, even when a majority of Americans support related policies. Some states focus more on reducing emissions, some more on resilience, and some are not especially focused on either. Such variability reflects a lack of national standards. Beyond decades-old laws around clean air and emergency response, the federal government had not required clean and resilient transportation planning or significant public input, and it certainly hadn’t tied major capital dollars to such environmental-focused planning. \n",
      "The past three years changed that situation. Together, the IIJA and IRA included four programs that prompted states to conduct climate-focused transportation planning and then offered significant federal funding to build related projects. While each program works a bit differently (and their total funding is only a small portion of what the federal government made available for public investment), together they create a more holistic national approach to clean and resilient transportation planning.1 The four programs are as follows: \n",
      "Now, with a Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump in office, the longevity of these programs has come into question. Already the Trump administration issued an executive order seeking an immediate pause on NEVI disbursements and potentially other clean transportation policies. If federal lawmakers choose to stop funding these programs, climate planning will revert solely to the political and cultural inclinations of each state’s lawmakers. In such a scenario, it’s important to know how states approach climate-related transportation planning beyond the IIJA and IRA’s new requirements.  \n",
      "This report aims to explain where climate-related transportation planning is today and where it might be if federal planning standards and capital funding are discontinued or not. We inventory each state’s mitigation and resilience plans—including GHG emissions monitoring and use of public input—both prior to and following the passage of the IIJA and IRA. The patterns within that inventory underscore what a reversion to past climate planning could be like, while offering lessons for state and federal lawmakers who want to adopt a more durable commitment to clean and resilient transportation. \n",
      "This report involved a detailed inventory of the climate-focused planning practices of departments of transportation (DOTs) in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. (henceforth referenced together as “states”). Based on a review of existing literature—including work by RMI, the National League of Cities, and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)—we generated a unique schema. This schema uses four categories—mitigation, resilience, GHG emissions measurement, and public input—to categorize state plans and their inputs, strategies, and desired outcomes. \n",
      "We then executed a detailed inventory of statewide and DOT-specific climate planning efforts. We relied strictly on publicly available materials and took states at their word. For example, a mitigation plan only needs to say that reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is one of its strategies for the state to receive credit. Our completed schema was then validated by expert interviews in nearly every state and adjusted accordingly. Despite our deference to state DOTs and experts, our research may not have uncovered all relevant plans and policies. We invite state DOTs and other stakeholders to submit those.  \n",
      "Explore the interactive state scorecard\n",
      "There is no doubt: The IIJA and IRA have had a positive impact on nationwide planning to reduce transportation’s GHG emissions. Those two bills included three state-focused planning programs that each required states to submit mitigation plans if they wanted to be eligible for larger grants, whether those grants would support capital projects (CRP and NEVI) or broader implementation efforts (CPRG). \n",
      "Every state responded by submitting official plans to at least one program, with 44 states submitting plans to all three. NEVI received plans from all 50 states and Washington, D.C. By contrast, three states didn’t submit CRP plans (Alaska, Florida, and North Dakota), which meant those states relinquished a total of $443 million in guaranteed funding.4 Along with Florida, another four states (Iowa, Kentucky, South Dakota, and Wyoming) didn’t submit CPRG plans.  \n",
      "These numbers represent a significant increase in how many states have published formal clean transportation plans apart from the two federal laws. Our inventory found only 31 states published a broad mitigation strategy for their transportation sector, which is akin to what CRP requires.5 Meanwhile, only 24 states published broader electrification strategies that included a transportation focus, which is akin to what CPRG and NEVI require.6 Generally, Northeastern and Pacific Coast states were the most likely to submit both mitigation and electrification plans—and it’s easy to spot similar patterns with other national climate maps. By contrast, states in the Southeast and Great Plains were far less likely to have adopted mitigation plans. \n",
      "With so many states using IIJA and IRA funding to expand their clean transportation planning, there’s reason to be optimistic that those new plans will motivate cleaner alternatives on the ground. Our inventory found all 31 states that drafted separate mitigation plans chose to prioritize both electrification projects such as charging infrastructure and VMT-reducing projects such as new bike lanes, safe streets, and public transportation within their mitigation plans. If that pattern holds, then it’s reasonable to expect both CRP funding and states’ own revenues will flow to more projects that promote lower transportation emissions.  \n",
      "Resilience planning is beginning to take hold across the country, with 32 states having now published detailed plans to protect their transportation networks. These plans tend to focus on vulnerability assessments, with flooding the most common risk cited. In the most detailed of these plans—such as those of California, Minnesota, and North Carolina—the authors include recommendations for future actions by transportation-focused agencies, peer agencies, and legislatures.  \n",
      "Just as importantly, an overwhelming number of these states are using their plans to inform broader agency priorities. We found that 31 of the 32 states declared that their resilience plans would inform project selections, while one other state noted it would incorporate its resilience plan into broader planning priorities. \n",
      "Among these 32 states, 17 are also one step closer to accessing significant fiscal advantages. New federal law under the PROTECT formula program offers lower matching rates for states that include a specific project in their Resilience Improvement Plan (a 7% reduction) or simply ensure their plan is “incorporated into” long-range transportation plans (a 3% reduction). Those 17 states have at least completed official Resilience Improvement Plans. Because these states had existing plans to draw upon or even adapt while developing their Resilience Improvement Plans, they were among the best-positioned to take advantage of tens of millions of dollars in savings via reduced federal matching rates.  \n",
      "The concerning finding, however, is that 19 states have no resilience plan of any kind. Even with a significant uptick in extreme weather events and rising damages to transportation assets, these states continue to overlook the importance of studying risk exposures of their transportation networks. These 19 states are effectively choosing to pay higher rates for resilience-focused improvements, since they won’t qualify for federal bonuses, and they may be leaving 2% of PROTECT funding strictly offered for planning activities on the table entirely.  \n",
      "There are some clear regional patterns across this data. Many Southeastern and Great Plains states did not create resilience plans. The absence of plans in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas is especially surprising, as those states face some of the highest risk exposures to changing climate conditions. By contrast, more Western states already facing higher drought conditions, wildfires, and other risks have taken a lead on resilience planning, as have a large portion of the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Great Lakes states.  \n",
      "Regardless of each state’s current approach, it’s likely to take years to track exactly how much resilience planning is informing actual construction practices. The need to continue monitoring investments underscores a finding from our larger state inventory: The public needs transparent project selection data to better assess policy priorities and hold state officials accountable for any stated resilience ambitions. \n",
      "As the country’s highest-emitting sector, there is no way to hit America’s emission targets without governments, industry, and households working together to adopt cleaner transportation behaviors and technologies. That’s the clear goal within state mitigation plans, including greater adoption of electric vehicles and reducing total miles traveled. Yet those plans are only one piece of the puzzle. States must also be willing to understand where transportation GHGs are currently being emitted—including by what modes—and use regular monitoring to compare progress against baselines. \n",
      "However, measuring GHG emissions has quickly become one of the more contentious issues in federal transportation policymaking. At the time of publication, there is ongoing litigation between the Federal Highway Administration—which seeks to use existing statutory authority to require state DOTs and metropolitan planning organizations to estimate GHG emissions from vehicles travelling on federal-aid highways and to set declining targets for future emissions—and 21 state attorneys general (plus Texas) contesting the rule. Regardless of how the courts eventually rule on the matter (or if the Trump administration decides to abandon the rule), analyzing past measurement efforts can help explain the two camps, including 15 states that have written in favor of the rule.\n",
      "We inventoried whether states measured: 1) overall GHG emissions; and 2) emissions solely from the transportation sector. Overall, 26 states measured both, although Utah’s overall inventory was incomplete. Of these 26 states, 24 also created both mitigation and resilience plans to complement their emissions data. In other words, states taking the most comprehensive approach to climate-related transportation planning are also the most likely to measure GHG emissions. \n",
      "Still, that leaves about half of all states not measuring emissions at all. Not coincidentally, most of the states choosing not to measure GHG emissions are also part of the lawsuit challenging the Federal Highway Administration rule. These states are also predominantly led by Republican governors. Yet politics isn’t the sole explanation for the lack of GHG measurement; Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin all conducted resilience and mitigation planning, elected Democratic leadership, and still didn’t publish GHG emission levels. It could be a valuable research project to interrogate why certain states are choosing not to measure emissions. \n",
      "Transportation planning has a long-standing tradition of using public input to inform an agency’s long-term goals, identify where the system may be falling short, and advance projects that will address both. Soliciting public input, then, is instrumental in bringing accountability to public governance of the transportation system. However, based on our inventory, too few states offer avenues for the public to participate in the climate-related transportation planning process.  \n",
      "One of the most valuable ways officials can hear from the public is reporting critical infrastructure failures and other environmental risks in real time. With enormous numbers of daily travelers and freight operators using the system, agencies would be wise to tap all the extra people who have a sense of what may be ailing the system. However, only seven states use platforms that enable people to submit both general climate-related concerns or report vulnerable infrastructure; Washington, D.C., for example, lets its residents request “green infrastructure maintenance” on assets such as permeable pavements. Another eight states offer a method to report flooding or drainage issues, but not other concerns such as exposure to extreme heat. That leaves 36 states with no climate-specific public input platform at all. \n",
      "Another valuable input method is soliciting comments on long-term mitigation and resilience plans. Whether it’s holding public meetings across the state or hosting web-based commentary platforms, states should allow the general public to respond to the long-range plans agency staff craft. In this case, only 18 states solicited public input on both long-range mitigation and resilience plans, with another seven states receiving input on just one plan.7 \n",
      "The lack of input confirms a more generalized finding from our prior research into state transportation accountability, with most states failing to offer enough opportunities for the public to offer input.  \n",
      "The past three years may represent a turning point when it comes to climate-related transportation planning at the state level. Aided by direct federal funding support, more states are now producing emissions mitigation and climate resilience plans apart from federal law. While not all state plans include the same level of detail (some states simply repackage federal emissions data, for example, and some states still haven’t completed resilience plans), there is no doubt that recent federal legislation incentivized greater planning activity at the state level.  \n",
      "Yet all that planning activity is exactly why the election of President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress should concern industry stakeholders and the general public. If new federal leadership chooses to reduce or eliminate support for emissions-focused programs, the historic record suggests roughly half the states may revert to far less mitigation planning. The record is slightly better around resilience, but there are still many Southeastern and Great Plains states that are falling behind. \n",
      "That makes the next two years a critical time to justify exactly why climate-focused transportation planning is valuable. With partisan tensions high around climate-related issues, arguments in favor of mitigation and resilience should use politically agnostic frames and rely on unassailable data. Fortunately, with so many new plans published and capital projects funded, there is a growing pool of evidence to interrogate and present to lawmakers both in the federal government and state capitals. And with the IIJA expiring in late 2026 and 38 gubernatorial elections happening by that time, there is an unquestionable window to demonstrate progress. \n",
      "Based on the findings in this report, we recommend the following actions to support more clean and resilient transportation policies: \n",
      "Federally, Congress should work with USDOT to evaluate CRP, PROTECT, and NEVI. Adopting new formula programs isn’t a minor reform; such apportioned programs are meant to deliver long-term stability, giving their recipients—primarily states—years of steady funding to execute multiyear projects and programs. The new Congress and USDOT leadership owe it to the bill writers, funding recipients, and system users to develop a detailed account of what CRP, PROTECT, and NEVI deliver. That’s especially the case for capital projects, which should be compared to projects funded by more traditional programs.8 The evaluation should also include an analysis of the predicted effects of these projects on the stated goals of each program: reduction in transportation emissions and a more resilient transportation system, respectively. Congress positioned themselves well for this type of evaluation by requiring USDOT to develop performance measures tracking the effectiveness of PROTECT and NEVI projects. Though no analogous requirement exists for CRP, Congress could enact one.9 \n",
      "Those evaluations should then inform a multiyear extension of the CRP and PROTECT programs. Now that states have developed plans for these formula funds, Congress should give states time to deliver on their goals via reformed capital project selection and other modifications to their more traditional business practices. Infrastructure delivers on decades-long cycles; Congress needs to give these two programs space to show that they can help people and communities achieve better outcomes, especially relative to projects funded under more traditional programs. Since NEVI effectively delivers funding to the private owners of charging infrastructure (versus how CRP and PROTECT invest in publicly owned infrastructure), there’s reason to wait and see if the market would continue to benefit from public funding support. \n",
      "To complement the planning and capital funding, Congress should also require states to collect and publish data on the condition of locally owned major roadways, ideally by augmenting current planning dollars. As our previous research found, states are generally failing to monitor the conditions of their locally owned roads, which make up the majority of the system’s length. We can’t prepare the entire system for climate resilience until we know which assets are most vulnerable. States that collect, incorporate, and publish comprehensive conditions data will be better able to ensure resilience dollars are flowing to the most vulnerable portions of publicly owned systems.  \n",
      "States need not wait for these federal reforms, either. For the tens of states that are either behind on their mitigation planning, resilience planning, or both, their state legislators can enact their own planning and investment requirements to ensure they protect the climate security of their residents and businesses. It’s worth remembering that states are the dominant fiscal agent within the transportation system; their own-source revenues are nearly as large as locally generated revenues, and they exhibit the largest control of total dollars. The authority and monies are there to adopt more pro-climate policies, and states such as Colorado and Minnesota have adopted laws that can serve as models.  \n",
      "To enhance their planning efforts, state legislators should require their DOT colleagues to expand opportunities for meaningful public input. Constituents are an invaluable set of eyes and ears to support the professionals working within state DOTs and partner agencies. The people who regularly use the system are naturally suited to report where flooding is getting worse, the most difficult neighborhoods to evacuate from, or where air quality seems to be impacting public health. Soliciting more public input—and then including slots for public stakeholders to serve on executive planning committees—are easy and invaluable steps to serve the public’s best interests. \n",
      "Finally, states should prepare their budgets in 2026 and beyond to compensate for the potential loss of federal climate-related funding, ideally by using a climate-focused capital account as a rainy-day fund. While we believe Congress should continue funding CRP and PROTECT, the risk of funding cuts is tangible. If funding is reduced, there’s a real chance that each state DOT’s environmentally focused programs and projects will face a fiscal cliff. Such reductions are especially dangerous for multiyear projects that are underway and using federal funding. Legislators and agency leads may want to consider launching a rainy-day fund (or repurposing current capital accounts) to insure against those losses. States such as Maine and California can act as examples for peers nationwide. Even if Congress extends the program, the rainy-day funds can augment immediate funding or be held for other future climate threats. \n",
      "Climate-focused transportation professionals are right to be concerned about Donald Trump’s reelection and the Republican Party assuming control of the U.S. Congress. Just as the IIJA and IRA initiated significant federal investments in clean and resilient transportation, the need to reauthorize the IIJA plus other rulemaking opportunities now gives Washington’s new leaders the chance to mothball early progress.  \n",
      "We believe such a move would be a mistake, but there’s reason for optimism. Those new federal laws are already showing results through expanded state climate planning. With the opportunity to study what capital projects those programs deliver—plus the prospect of more households and businesses continuing to adopt electric vehicles—even a conservative Congress could be persuaded to keep funding for another legislative cycle. The key will be clear and convincing evidence. \n",
      "Yet if federal lawmakers turn their backs on cleaner transportation and physically secure assets, then states can fill the gap. Our inventory confirms that many are already taking a leading role, and there’s no reason they can’t continue to deliver a transportation system that’s built for new climate realities. Instead, there’s more pressure in those tens of states that are behind. If governors and legislators truly want to protect the economic and physical security of their constituents, adopting more climate-focused transportation planning is an obvious place to start. \n",

      "TITLE: Rethinking place-based economic security in the age of climate migration\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "This month, California wildfires displaced tens of thousands of people and caused an estimated economic loss of $250 billion. As the climate grows increasingly inhospitable, we must rethink how to provide for Americans’ economic well-being. Right now, economic security is like a landline phone: tied to your home or workplace. We need to make it more like a cell phone: accessible wherever you are.\n",
      "The United States has long encouraged homeownership as a primary pathway to personal wealth accumulation. As of 2024, about 66% of American households are homeowners. The median wealth of American households was $166,900 in 2021; when excluding home equity, that value drops by about two-thirds, to $57,900. But climate change makes homes a less reliable store of wealth, not just because climate disasters destroy homes, but because climate risk raises insurance costs and lowers home values. In some high-risk areas, insurers have simply stopped renewing coverage, leaving homeowners one hurricane or wildfire away from losing most of their savings.  \n",
      "The system of homeownership being destabilized by climate change was already in need of fundamental reform. Historically, federal housing programs segregated neighborhoods and prevented Black applicants from accessing the financing available to white applicants, leaving Black and Hispanic families with much lower rates of homeownership. Our colleague Andre Perry has demonstrated that Black neighborhoods continue to be undervalued. As Princeton professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor writes, “there has not been an instance in the last 100 years when the housing market has operated fairly, without racial discrimination.” White families received 121% of the average 2019 Home Mortgage Interest Deduction tax benefit, while Black families received 54% and Hispanic families received 38%.\n",
      "As we have written previously, housing inequities are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Black and Hispanic communities have disproportionately high exposure to climate risk on average while deriving a greater percentage of their wealth from home equity. And, as others have noted, the role that property values play in wealth accumulation incentivizes homeowners to treat homeownership as a zero-sum game, opposing new building in their neighborhoods and contributing to the national housing shortage. In communities incorporating climate migrants, unwillingness to build new housing will be especially damaging.\n",
      "Like the economic security of homeownership, the economic security provided by place-based public and private benefits will be challenged by climate migration. Eligibility requirements and generosity of unemployment insurance, nutrition assistance, and other social protections depend on what state you live in. Private benefits like health insurance often tie workers to places through “job lock.” Reapplying for benefits in a new area places administrative burdens on climate migrants who are already dealing with the challenges of relocation, and, as Hurricane Katrina demonstrated, patchwork state programs can struggle to effectively administer benefits after mass displacement. As the U.S. population shifts in response to the changing climate, our geography-based system of economic security will struggle to meet Americans’ needs.\n",
      "Consider in contrast portable and near-universal programs like Social Security and Medicare. These programs reduce place-based challenges to economic security; regardless of where a person moves, they will receive their benefits. Social Security and Medicare are much more racially equitable than regressive spending like the home mortgage interest deduction. In fact, the programs reduce racial disparities in wealth and healthcare access. The structure of Social Security also encourages political participation. As the political scientist Andrea Louise Campbell has documented, the program dramatically increased the political mobilization of elders by providing them with money, time, and a direct interest in politics. Unlike homeownership, the programs do not incentivize people to use their political power to protect their own assets at the expense of others—they create a cross-class alliance of people with a shared interest in maintaining their benefits.\n",
      "Broadening portable social welfare benefits is therefore a critical component of the response to climate migration. Social insurance already constitutes an underappreciated part of disaster recovery that helps communities compensate for the economic effects of disasters. Expanding these programs would help mitigate the unequal costs borne by marginalized people facing climate displacement. A robust system of social welfare benefits also helps ensure that marginalized communities are empowered to participate in decisions on how to respond to climate change.\n",
      "No set of policies will eliminate the devastating consequences of climate change, and addressing those consequences must include an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. But expansive portable benefits can protect the basic material needs of individuals and communities harmed by the climate crisis. Designing these benefits is no small task and will require careful research. A central principle guiding this research must be a reconsideration of old assumptions about place-based economic security. Federal social insurance programs, not homeowner subsidies, provide a model for Americans’ economic security in a time of increasing mobility on a warming planet.\n",

      "BODY:\n",
      "When the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was passed into law under President Bill Clinton in 2000, it did more than elevate trade and investment on the U.S.-Africa policy agenda. It also helped to forge a bipartisan consensus in Congress based on the foreign policy rationale that the U.S. has interests in Africa that were worth investing in. This consensus has endured over the last 24 years and has led to the creation of landmark initiatives such as the George W. Bush administration’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the passage of the BUILD Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law, creating the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This consensus has also supported approximately $8 billion in development assistance administered in Africa by the U.S. State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) between FY2012 and FY2022, in annual inflation-adjusted dollars.1\n",
      "The question is whether the bipartisan consensus will be sustained when the 119th Congress is sworn in and the Trump administration assumes office in January 2025. More immediately, a few pieces of legislation will be key to watch in 2025.\n",
      "There appears to be broad support for the reauthorization of the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), set to expire on October 6, 2025, as the DFC Modernization and Reauthorization Act of 2024 passed through House Committee on Foreign Affairs in July with a vote of 43-2.2 In reauthorizing the DFC under the House bill, the agency would be able to operate for another seven years, its contingency liability would be doubled to $120 billion, and the number of countries where the DFC can invest would be increased.3 Already in FY2024, the DFC committed a record $12 billion of investments across 181 deals in 44 countries.4 Unfortunately, the DFC reauthorization was not attached to the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, as some had hoped it would be, and will have to be taken up when Congress reconvenes in 2025.5\n",
      "The DFC is likely to play an important role in a Trump administration Africa policy that analysts expect to be transactional and pro-business.6 Indeed, in the first Trump administration then-DFC CEO Adam Boehler sought to invest $5 billion in Morocco (which coincided with Morocco’s recognition of Israel as part of the Abraham Accords) and another $5 billion in Ethiopia.7 While both targets were unmet, it reflects a strong private sector approach that is likely to reemerge in the incoming administration, which views investments by American entrepreneurs and businesses as drivers of development, job creation, and wealth generation in Africa and the U.S.8\n",
      "Under the second Trump administration, critical minerals are poised to be a key priority, given that President Trump signed the Energy Act of 2020. The act directed the secretary of energy to develop a comprehensive forecast of projected critical mineral requirements for U.S. national security.9 In December of 2024, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del) and Todd Young (R-Ind) introduced bipartisan legislation that would strengthen critical minerals supply chains in Africa and elsewhere.10 As Africa is estimated to hold about 30% of the world’s critical minerals, and with the Democratic Republic of the Congo producing 70% of the world’s cobalt, initiatives such as the Lobito Corridor project could also receive ongoing support.11\n",
      "A concerted effort was made in December to renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which is set to expire in September 2025. In April, Senators James Risch (R-Idaho) and Coons introduced a bipartisan bill that would renew the trade pact for 16 years until 2041.12 In December, Representative John James (R-Mich) introduced legislation that would extend AGOA for 12 years.13 Apart from differences over the timeframes, the two bills were aligned in their support for an enhanced AGOA. Nevertheless, AGOA was not included in the continuing resolution (CR) which Congressional leaders reached on December 1714 (and which President-elect Donald Trump opposed), and the African trade legislation will have to be taken up anew in the next Congress.\n",
      "One issue likely to complicate the reauthorization process is South Africa’s continued eligibility. Senator Risch, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has criticized South Africa’s “continued actions that subvert U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.”15 Key members of President-elect Trump’s nominated national security team, including Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and Representatives Michael Walz (R-Fla), and Elise Stefanik (R-NY) have expressed similar concerns.16 Members of Congress will have to weigh South Africa’s foreign policy actions against the fact that the country is the continent’s strongest democracy and most industrial economy, the incoming chair of the G20, and provides nearly 100% of the chromium that the U.S. imports and more than 25% of U.S. requirements for manganese, titanium, and platinum.17\n",
      "In addition to the South Africa issue, organized labor has voiced concerns about the need for stronger labor and environmental protections in a renewed AGOA.18 Labor’s concerns were a factor in AGOA not being included in the December CR.\n",
      "Another challenge for AGOA is whether the preference program is sufficient to enable the U.S. to compete effectively with China in Africa. In 2023, two-way trade between the U.S. and Africa was $67.5 billion, while China’s two-way trade was more than four times as large at $282.1 billion.19 Non-oil imports under AGOA have averaged $4.3 billion between 2018 and 2022, which is just over one-tenth of total U.S. imports from the region.20\n",
      "To bolster the U.S. presence in the African market, Congress could provide tax incentives for U.S. companies to invest in value-added projects, especially in critical minerals, as it did in Section 30D of the Inflation Reduction Act.21 This would lower the risk and provide incentives for U.S. companies to make the long-term investments required for the U.S. to become competitive in this vital sector.\n",
      "When AGOA was passed in 2000 and renewed in 2015, key constituencies, including the private sector, governors, mayors, state legislators, and civil society organizations, voiced their support. It is likely that a similar effort will be necessary for AGOA to be renewed in a timely manner. Given that one-quarter of the world’s population will be domiciled in Africa in 25 years, and without effective tools to support U.S. companies, the U.S. risks losing out commercially in the African market to China and the emerging “middle powers” that include the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.22\n",
      "An existing tool to support U.S. companies is Prosper Africa. Created in the first Trump administration, the initiative has helped to close 1,852 deals valued at $86 billion over the last four years in 49 countries.23 However, a prospective problem for Prosper Africa is that it is housed in the U.S. Agency for International Development, and, like all government agencies, is a potential target for budget cuts by the newly announced Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Indeed, the Trump administration sought to cut $4 billion in foreign aid in 2019, but President Trump ultimately sided with the many bipartisan voices in Congress who opposed the cuts.24 Additionally, in its budget for FY2021, the Trump administration announced a 22% cut to critical foreign assistance programs, which was rejected by the incoming Biden administration.25\n",
      "To safeguard this increasingly important instrument that promotes U.S. investment on the continent, Congress could reconsider the Prosper Africa Act that was introduced by Representative Michael McCaul in 2022.26\n",
      "PEPFAR is another program that has enjoyed strong bipartisan support since it was first authorized in 2003. It is also one of the most impactful programs the U.S. has ever implemented, providing life-saving medicines to more than 25 million Africans. Nevertheless, there has been a sharp erosion of support among Republicans who claim the program funds “abortion on demand.”27 There is also a view that PEPFAR has transcended its original intent and that HIV is no longer an emergency, in part because science is on the brink of producing vaccines that will provide total protection against the virus to young women.28 While the program has been reauthorized for one year through March 25, 2025, uncertainty persists as to whether Congress will vote to refund PEPFAR and, if so, for how long.29 In leaving PEPFAR unfunded, the U.S. would lose an invaluable instrument of soft power that continues to make a transformative difference in the lives of millions of people on the continent.\n",
      "As President-elect Trump assumes office once again in January 2025, the decisions made around the reauthorization of the DFC, the extension of AGOA, and whether to fund PEPFAR will serve as important indicators of the Trump administration’s approach to U.S.-Africa relations.\n",

      "TITLE: What is US foreign assistance?\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "Eight decades of American foreign aid has generated confusion among U.S. taxpayers on how and how many tax dollars are spent on foreign assistance.\n",
      "As we are in the midst of an election cycle, it is important that candidates, voters, and media have a better understanding of how taxpayer dollars are currently used to advance our national interest.\n",
      "Foreign assistance falls into one of three basic categories:\n",
      "The relative proportions vary each year. The 2022 budget of $70 billion was representative of the split, with humanitarian assistance accounting for approximately one-quarter, development assistance for almost two-thirds, and security assistance less than one-fifth.\n",
      "Very little assistance is delivered as cash to governments, a recent exception being support for the government of Ukraine (the use of which is checked and rechecked) in response to the Russian invasion. Most funds for humanitarian and development assistance are provided through U.S., global, and local organizations and businesses.\n",
      "Historically, as demonstrated by the chart below, foreign aid peaked at 3% of U.S. GDP during the Marshall Plan program to resuscitate Europe following the end of World War II. Subsequently, it ranged from 1% to just less than 0.5% during much of the Cold War. In recent decades, it has hovered in the range of less than 0.33% of U.S. GDP.\n",
      "In terms of the federal budget obligations, foreign assistance accounts for about 1%. In fiscal year 2022, foreign assistance totaled $58 billion and in fiscal year 2023 about $63 billion (final figure not available).\n",
      "YES & NO. The U.S. is both generous and penurious—it provides more official government assistance than any other country, but considerably less as a portion of our national income. There is a broad international commitment (to which the U.S. has never pledged) that wealthy countries should annually provide 0.7% of GDP to assist developing countries. For 2023, five countries—Norway, Luxembourg, Sweden, Germany, and Denmark—met or exceeded that benchmark. The average for all wealthy nations is around 0.3%, with the U.S. ranking at the bottom.\n",
      "As to giving by the American people, the most recent (2020) compilation of all U.S. private (individuals and institutions) contributions to overseas causes totaled $49.3 billion; the level of official U.S. foreign assistance expenditures for that year was $47 billion.\n",
      "The U.S. foreign assistance structure is complex with more than 20 U.S. government agencies have a role in providing foreign assistance. The most recent data (2022) shows the principal agency for foreign assistance, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), responsible for some 60% of foreign assistance, followed by the Department of State at nearly 30%, the Department of the Treasury at 5%, the Department of Health and Human Services at 3%, and the Departments of Defense and Agriculture and the Millennium Challenge Corporation each under 1%. \n",
      "NO. It can be difficult to identify with precision who implements all of assistance. A sizeable portion of U.S. assistance is passed from one U.S. government agency to another for further subsequent allocation to other implementing entities. When the money does eventually leave the U.S. government, the graph below shows that only a small fraction goes directly to other governments. In the period 2015-2022, just less than 20% went to nonprofit organizations, a little over 10% to the private sector, and less than 20% to multilateral organizations. While the U.S. provides assistance directly to only a few governments, recipient countries—and therefore government—indirectly benefit from the services and support provided to local communities and organizations.\n",
      "Typically, when the U.S. wants to support communities and people and bolster reform in a country that is ruled by a corrupt, uncooperative government, U.S. assistance goes through private channels—NGOs, community groups, businesses, universities, other private entities—or international and multilateral organizations. Accountability of U.S. economic assistance is high—the U.S. imposes stringent, some would say onerous, reporting and accounting requirements on recipients of U.S. assistance, and the General Accounting Office and agency inspector generals investigate possible misuse.\n",
      "LESS SO TODAY. During the Cold War struggle to stem the spread of communism, when foreign aid was often based on the premise that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” no matter what the nature of the government, aid did find its way to autocratic governments. That substantially changed in the 1990s following the demise of the Soviet Union. However, there are countries that are at best “semi-democratic” and with autocratic elements but where U.S. assistance ends up. This assistance goes mostly through civil society organizations for humanitarian reasons or because of strong U.S. security interests in their stability and that of neighboring countries. However, there is reason to worry that less concern with autocracy may reappear with the abiding anxiety over terrorism and conflict in our post-9/11 era and in a world increasingly dominated by geopolitical considerations, highlighted by concerns over anti-Western and anti-rule-of-law attitudes and actions by countries such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.\n",
      "YES. The U.S. government requires regular monitoring and reporting on how and whether assistance programs are working, and periodic evaluations of results. There is evidence that development and humanitarian programs produce considerable results, but less so for programs driven by foreign policy and security purposes. While foreign assistance is by no means the only driver of human progress, which rests primarily in the hands of the government and people of each country, it does contribute in specific areas and to the overall environment supporting human advancement and has chalked up notable successes.\n",
      "Of particular note:\n",
      "Further, the record of the advancement of human welfare to which foreign assistance has and is making a contribution—but by no means has played the primary role—is impressive, including:\n",
      "BOTH. Foreign aid typically aims to support economic, social, and political development and security of recipient countries and their people. At the same time, such assistance also advances one or all of the following overriding U.S. interests:\n",
      "In addition, a sizeable portion of U.S. assistance is spent in the United States on the purchase of food aid, medicines, equipment, and salaries of Americans who manage projects and provide technical advice.\n",
      "YES. While the term “foreign aid” is not universally popular and polling reveals that some feel our foreign policy is overextended and would prefer the money be spent to fix our own problems, Americans support U.S. active engagement in the world. Polling over several decades shows consistent approval of U.S. assistance efforts, with support particularly strong for purposes such as humanitarian assistance, improving people’s health, advancing rights and opportunities for women and girls, educating children, and helping poor countries develop their economies.\n",
      "A June 2024 poll by the Reagan Institute found that 54% of Americans believe the U.S. should be more involved and lead in international affairs versus 33% who want less U.S. engagement.\n",
      "The poll further reveals that 57% think U.S. involvement is beneficial for our country; 78% believe leadership is essential for promoting trade and boosting our economy; 77% that the U.S. has a moral obligation to stand up for human rights and democracy; and 86% that a strong military is essential to maintaining peace and prosperity.\n",
      "BIPARTISAN. This may seem surprising given recent political divisiveness.\n",
      "Over the past 50 years a majority of Americans—Democrats, Republicans, and Independents—have supported U.S. active engagement in world affairs. Up until the past decade, Republicans were somewhat more supportive than Democrats and Independents. But, as shown in the chart below, since 2016 the positions of those who identify as Democrats and Republicans have flipped, with Democratic support increasing and Republican support declining (see chart below from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs).\n",
      "But looking at foreign assistance, historically, Democratic policymakers (administrations and Congress) have been more supportive than Republicans policymakers. Take the Truman administration, which initiated the Marshall Plan. Or, in the 1990s, when votes in Congress on foreign aid spending were close, appropriations bills garnered more Democratic than Republican votes. Yet every president, Democratic and Republican, apart from Donald Trump, has been a strong proponent of foreign aid.\n",
      "In fact, some of the most rapid increases in foreign aid have come during Republican presidencies. For instance, despite George W. Bush being a skeptic of foreign aid before entering the White House, the budget for foreign assistance double from $16 billion in 2001 to $33 billion in 2004. Since the creation in the early 2000s of President Bush’s well-regarded signature programs—the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the President’s Malaria Initiative—foreign aid carries a Republican as well as a Democratic brand and has received congressional support from both parties.\n",
      "There was bipartisan rejection of proposals by the Trump administration to cut the U.S. international affairs budget by one-third, and, although in 2024 a small number of congressional opponents succeeded in delaying congressional consideration of supplemental foreign aid legislation, the bill passed the Congress with bipartisan support. On June 28, 2024, 80% of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives on a bipartisan vote rejected an amendment to eliminate foreign assistance from the Fiscal Year 2025 federal budget.\n",
      "A majority of the American people appear to understand that providing assistance to countries and people in need—whether for reasons of humanitarian relief, economic advancement, or security—advances the best interests of both the recipient country and America. We often disagree over the amount of support and to whom and how it should be provided, but collectively we understand that foreign assistance is an extension of American values and self-interest—our national interest in terms of our own and other countries’ security, economy, and humanitarian values.\n",

      "URL: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-are-tariffs-and-why-are-they-rising/\n",
      "TITLE: What are tariffs, and why are they rising?\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "Tariffs are taxes that countries impose on imported goods when they cross the border. From the founding of the United States until 1914, when the federal income tax was introduced, tariffs were the main source of revenue to the federal government. After World War II, the U.S. joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with 22 other countries, which aimed to promote international trade, and began decreasing tariffs. The downward trend in tariff rates continued until 2018, when the Trump administration raised tariffs on several products, especially those imported from China, igniting a trade war. Tariffs on China stopped increasing in January 2020 but have yet to decrease substantially, and remain well above their pre-2018 levels. The Biden administration has kept Trump-era tariffs on China in place and raised them on steel, aluminum, medical equipment, electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells in May 2024. Unlike other taxes, which require the consent of Congress, legislation passed in 1934, 1962, and 1974 gives the executive branch leeway to lower tariff rates by up to 80% and to raise tariff rates if it serves a national security interest.\n",
      "Among the reasons that countries impose tariffs are to protect domestic industries (particularly those vital to national security), to incentivize foreign countries to change their practices, and to raise revenue. The Trump and Biden administrations said they imposed tariffs for the first two reasons.\n",
      "Even with the tariffs imposed during the Trump and Biden administrations, tariff revenues in fiscal year 2023 were slightly more than $80 billion, a small fraction of the $4.439 trillion in total U.S government revenues for that year. The global proliferation of free agreements since World War II has substantially lowered tariff rates, and in turn lowered tariff revenue in wealthy countries, though a number of developing countries still rely on tariffs for a substantial proportion of government revenues.\n",
      "The Trump administration argued tariffs were “imposed to encourage China to change [its] unfair practices,” as they were “threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers.” This statement cited a report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative which found that China’s actions “pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese entities … deprive U.S. technology owners of the ability to bargain … and support unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of U.S. companies.” The administration argued in January 2018 that its initial round of tariffs on washing machines was necessary, as increasing imports had hurt American washing machine manufacturers’ financial performance. The tariffs, which made imports more expensive, were supposed to increase domestic purchases of washing machines. Trump’s U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also argued in July of that year that “China [had] been engaging in industrial policy which [had] resulted in the transfer and theft of intellectual property and technology to the detriment of our economy,” prompting punitive tariffs to spur a change in policy. Trump frequently cited China’s business practices as the cause of the trade deficit between the U.S. and China, saying in June 2018 that “the United States [is] at a permanent and unfair disadvantage, which is reflected in our massive $376 billion trade imbalance in goods.”\n",
      "China responded to the initial round with retaliatory tariffs. This prompted both countries to continue increasing tariffs for the better part of two years. The U.S.-China trade war paused in January 2020, when the U.S. agreed not to impose planned tariffs on China, and China agreed to buy more U.S. exports. By this point, the level of U.S. tariffs on China had increased from under 5% to over 20%.\n",
      "The Biden administration has not reduced any of Trump’s tariffs on China, and in May 2024 raised tariffs on steel, aluminum, medical equipment, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells.\n",
      "Biden’s May 2024 tariff increases follow much of the same logic as Trump’s initial 2018 tariffs, albeit without mention of the U.S. trade deficit with China. In its release, the administration argued that “American workers continue to face unfair competition from China’s non-market overcapacity in steel and aluminum” and “encourage[d] China to eliminate its unfair trade practices.” The Biden administration, like the Trump administration, sees tariffs on China as both a punitive measure that might spur a change in Chinese industrial policy as well a way to protect domestic manufacturers.\n",
      "Though the Biden administration has drawn criticism from advocates of free trade in both parties for keeping protectionist trade policy, he also has important constituents who want to keep tariffs in place. At the start of his term, the U.S. steel industry, including its union workers, urged Biden to hold steady. In November 2023, Democratic senators Bob Casey Jr. and Sherrod Brown, both from Rust Belt states with many union workers, wrote a letter to Biden arguing that tariffs on steel and aluminum were still necessary.\n",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai was asked at a June 2024 event at the Atlantic Council where she agrees and differs with Trump’s former USTR Robert Lighthizer. She said they agree the U.S. has to “change [its] approach to trade,” that she and Lighthizer “share a lot of the same diagnoses” on the U.S.-China trade relationship, and that “one of the ways where Bob and I are most different is in rhetoric.”   While many economists and some policymakers in the past have emphasized the benefits of trade to American consumers, Tai and Lighthizer emphasize the risks that trade poses to American workers. For more on Tai’s views, see this interview from Vox.com.  For more on Lighthizer’s commentary, see this site, or his 2023 book, “No Trade is Free.”\n",
      "The burden of tariffs can fall on consumers (who may pay higher prices), on importers (who may absorb the cost by reducing their profits and not pass it along to consumers), on exporters (who may absorb the cost and accept lower net prices for their goods), or on some mix of those. Tariffs are often imposed on intermediate goods—goods that are used in the production of things that consumers buy—and this can both erode producers’ profits (unless they find domestic substitutes for those inputs) and the prices they charge consumers. Which party bears the heaviest burden depends on the specific market.\n",
      "A literature review by the Tax Foundation found that U.S. consumers and firms bore the brunt of costs in the recent trade war, with some studies finding partial pass-through (the price increases, but not by as much as the tariff, hurting both importers and consumers), others finding almost complete pass-through (the price increases by the amount of the tariff), and a couple of cases of over-shifting (the price increases by more than the amount of the tariff). They did not find substantial evidence that foreign exporters absorbed the economic burden of the tariffs by lowering prices.\n",
      "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says that the effect of tariffs on output can be ambiguous. On the one hand, some consumers end up buying domestic goods instead of imported goods, and tariff revenues make more resources available for private investment by decreasing the national deficit. These factors increase GDP. On the other, the purchasing power of consumers goes down as goods are more expensive, retaliatory tariffs decrease exports, and some businesses delay new investments out of caution. These factors all decrease GDP.\n",
      "On balance, economists tend to agree that free trade (low tariffs) increases economic growth more than protectionist trade policy (high tariffs). Free trade allows producers with comparative advantage to get their products to the market cheaply and efficiently, and tariffs get in the way. Additionally, while tariffs may protect infant industries, they can also reduce competition, with adverse effects on an economy. In the 20th century, many developing countries put large tariffs on imported goods using a strategy called “import substitution” to give a country’s domestic industries a leg up until they could compete with advanced countries. In practice, those industries often remained underdeveloped, as they never had to compete with better technology.\n",
      "Today’s advocates of tariffs say that the textbook models don’t resemble reality because China, in particular, heavily subsidizes key industries and gives them an advantage of over American producers—and could put them out of business altogether, giving China a monopoly.\n",
      "In August 2019, CBO estimated that the negative GDP effects of recent tariff increases had outweighed the positive ones and were decreasing real output by 0.3%. The Tax Foundation estimated in July 2023 that the long-run effects would bring GDP down by 0.2% and total employment down by 142,000 jobs. Economists Mary Amiti of the New York Fed, Stephen Redding of Princeton, and David Weinstein of Columbia found, in a 2020 working paper, that “U.S. tariffs continue to be almost entirely borne by U.S. firms and consumers.” Michael Pettis of the Carnegie Endowment noted that, even when the U.S.-China trade deficit decreases, as it did after the tariffs, the U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world increases by at least as much.\n",
      "Those worried about the threat that China poses to U.S. prosperity say the costs imposed by tariffs are worth the benefits. Total imports from China are down from pre-2018 trends as intended, and imports from China on products with high tariffs cratered in 2019 and 2020. While this shows signs of some economic decoupling, the effects have been partially offset by a surge in Chinese imports on products without tariffs.\n",
      "If messaging from the Biden administration and Trump campaign is any signal, the era of high tariffs will continue past 2024, though the nature and scope of the tariffs will depend on who wins the November 2024 election. Biden’s May 2024 tariff increases affect $18 billion worth of goods, while some Trump proposals would impose tariffs on all U.S. imports from China (over $400 billion) or on all U.S. imports (slightly under $4 trillion). After Biden’s announcement of increased tariffs in May 2024, Trump said increased tariffs should also apply to vehicles “and a lot of other products.”\n",
      " Trump also has suggested a flat 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on imports from China. This would constitute a very large increase, with one analysis predicting that this would cost the typical household $1,700 annually.\n",
      "In June 2024, Trump floated fully replacing the income tax with tariffs, which would effectively shift the burden of paying for government from upper-income Americans (because the income tax is progressive) to those who don’t make enough income to pay much, if any, income taxes.\n",
      "Economists Kim Clausing and Maury Obstfeldt argue that replacing the income tax with tariffs is impossible:\n",
      "“Tariffs are levied on imported goods, which totaled $3.1 trillion in 2023. The income tax is levied on incomes, which exceed $20 trillion; the U.S. government raises about $2 trillion in individual and corporate income taxes at present. It is literally impossible for tariffs to fully replace income taxes. Tariff rates would have to be implausibly high on such a small base of imports to replace the income tax, and as tax rates rose, the base itself would shrink as imports fall, making Trump’s $2 trillion goal unattainable.”\n",

      "TITLE: What is a government shutdown?\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "At the end of March 2024, Congress again averted government shutdown at the last minute—and finally funded the government for the full fiscal year (which was already six months old).\n",
      "In November 2023, Congress passed an unusual continuing resolution (dubbed a “laddered CR”) that continued funding at last year’s levels agencies funded by four appropriations bills (Agriculture, Energy and Water, Military Construction-Veterans, and Transportation-HUD)—until January 19, 2024. On January 18, Congress avoided a partial government shutdown by extending that deadline until March 1. Funding for agencies covered by the other eight appropriations bills, including Defense, had been slated to expire on February 2, 2024; the January 18 legislation extended that deadline to March 8. At the end of February, Congress extended the deadlines again—to March 8 for six appropriation bills, which finally passed Congress late in the day on March 8, funding those agencies through the end of the fiscal year in September 2024, and March 22 for the remaining six, including Defense and Homeland Security. In the early morning hours of March 23, the Senate passed and sent to the president those six appropriations bills.\n",
      "Under the Antideficiency Act (initially passed in 1884 and amended in 1950), federal agencies cannot spend or obligate any money without an appropriation (or other approval) from Congress. When Congress fails to enact the 12 annual appropriation bills, federal agencies must cease all non-essential functions until Congress acts. This is known as a government shutdown. If Congress enacts some but not all of the 12 appropriations bills, only agencies without appropriations have to shut down; this is known as a partial shutdown.\n",
      "During shutdowns, many federal employees are told not to report for work, though under a 2019 law they get paid retroactively when the shutdown ends. Government employees who provide what are deemed essential services, such as air traffic control and law enforcement, continue to work, but don’t get paid until Congress takes action to end the shutdown. All this applies only to the roughly 25% of federal spending subject to annual appropriation by Congress.\n",
      "Benefits such as Social Security and Medicare continue to flow because they are authorized by Congress in laws that do not need annual approval (although the services offered by Social Security benefit offices may be limited during a shutdown). In addition, the Treasury can continue to pay interest on U.S. Treasury debt on time.\n",
      "Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans, or government benefits; shuttered visitor centers and bathrooms at national parks; fewer food-safety inspections; and various inconveniences. Shutdowns are sufficiently likely that the White House Office of Management & Budget posts detailed contingency plans that government agencies maintain for shutdowns, as well as a 51-page Q&A on shutdown procedures.\n",
      "The plans are often quite specific. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s contingency plan, for instance, cautions: “During the shutdown, employees who have not been designated as excepted may not volunteer to work without pay. Such voluntary services are a violation of the Antideficiency Act and will not be permitted under any circumstances.” The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation says, “A staff person will be instructed to ensure that, at the end of the last day of work with appropriated funds, lights and electronic devices not needed during the shutdown are turned off.” Some agencies say operations will continue if they haven’t spent previously appropriated sums or if they have income from fees that they can tap. The National Gallery of Art, for instance, says it will remain open as long as it can tap such reserves, but will have to close if the shutdown lingers. And the Centers for Disease Control says that 46% of its employees (or 6,448 individuals) will remain on the job, including 2,518 who are “exempt” because their activities or positions are funded outside of the usual annual appropriation process, and 3,930 who are “excepted” because their activities are deemed necessary by implication, or for the safety of human life or protection of property. \n",
      "In a 1981 opinion, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti said that the president could continue to exercise his constitutional responsibilities during a shutdown. With that logic, lawyers for the federal courts and Congress have said that judges and members of Congress – and those who support them in their essential duties – can stay on the job even if the appropriations bills that fund them lapse. But some judicial and congressional employees are furloughed. \n",
      " \n",
      "In a shutdown, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, federal courts continue to operate for a while by drawing on fees they have collected (as distinguished from appropriations) and by delaying new hires, non-case related travel, etc. If the shutdown is prolonged and those funds are spent, then the courts say they can continue work that supports their constitutional powers. \n",
      " \n",
      "As for Congress, the Congressional Research Service says, “Due to their constitutional responsibilities and a permanent appropriation for congressional pay, members of Congress are not subject to furlough.” Only those congressional staffers whose work is “required to support Congress with its constitutional responsibilities or those necessary to protect life and property” can remain on the job. But even those congressional staff don’t get paid during a shutdown, though they do get paid retroactively.  \n",
      "In June 2023, with the backing of Republican leaders in the House and Senate, Congress passed and President Biden signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which lifted the ceiling on the federal debt and set limits on annual appropriated spending—one for defense, one for non-defense—for the fiscal years 2024 (which begins October 1, 2023) and 2025. At the time, the expectations were that this settled the overall size of the appropriations bills, and Congress would pass 12 bills that added up to the agreed-upon levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee has followed that path and has passed all 12 appropriations bills with bipartisan support. But House Republicans, unhappy with the agreement Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck with the White House, want to spend less than the levels specified in the Fiscal Responsibility Act—much to the consternation of Democrats and the White House, which says President Biden would veto the appropriations bills that are pending in the House. The House bills also include provisions on abortion, contraception, regulation of tobacco, and healthcare for trans persons that aren’t likely to pass the Senate.\n",
      "When the House and Senate pass different bills, the next step is a conference committee at which the two chambers are supposed to forge a compromise, which goes to a vote in each chamber before going to the president. That is likely to be very contentious.\n",
      "When Congress hasn’t passed appropriations bills for an entire fiscal year, it sometimes passes temporary spending bills—continuing resolutions—that fund government operations until a specified date. Continuing resolutions often, although not always, continue the level of funding at the prior year’s appropriations level. According to the Government Accountability Office, there were 47 continuing resolutions (often known as “CRs” inside the Beltway) between fiscal years 2010 and 2022. They ranged from one day to just under six months. Although they keep the government operating, the GAO said they can be difficult for government agencies to manage, because they often have to plan for a government shutdown because they can’t be sure a CR will pass, they can disrupt agency hiring plans, and they make planning difficult.\n",
      "The Fiscal Responsibility Act has an unusual feature that was intended to discourage Congress from funding the government with a continuing resolution beyond the end of December 2023. It didn’t have the intended effect. The law said that if a CR were in effect on January 1, 2024 (and that was the case), then limits on spending would be automatically revised downward from the levels set in the law. But the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a December 2023 memo that the law delays any action to restrain spending to comply with those lower limits until April 30. If Congress enacts full-year appropriations before April 30, it would likely waive those lower spending limits before they take effect.\n",
      "There have been four shutdowns where operations were affected for more than one business day. In 1995-1996, President Clinton and the Republican Congress were unable to agree on spending levels; the government shut down twice, for a total of 26 days. In 2013, a standoff over funding for the Affordable Care Act resulted in a 16-day shutdown. And in December 2018 and January 2019, a dispute over border wall funding led to a shutdown that lasted 35 days; it was a partial shutdown because Congress had previously passed five of the 12 appropriation bills.\n",
      "A shutdown of a few days is a hassle—and undermines public confidence in the capacity of U.S. politicians to do the people’s business—but is unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy. A prolonged shutdown, however, can cause bigger problems, albeit most temporary. Goldman Sachs estimates that a shutdown would reduce GDP growth by about 0.2 percentage point each week it lasts, and that growth would rise by the same amount in the quarter following the shutdown’s end.\n",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the five-week partial shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019—partial because five of the 12 appropriation bills had been passed—reduced the level of GDP growth by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018 ($3 billion in 2019 dollars) and by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2019 ($8 billion), mainly from the loss of furloughed federal workers’ pay and the delay in federal spending on goods and services. “Although most of the real GDP lost…will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates that about $3 billion will not be,” CBO said. In other words, the GDP in 2019 was estimated to be 0.02% lower because of the shutdown than it otherwise would have been. The CBO estimates did not account for such indirect effects as the inability of some businesses to obtain federal permits or apply for federal loans.\n",

      "TITLE: The difference in how the wealthy make money—and pay taxes\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "In a famous conversation, the author F. Scott Fitzgerald is credited with saying that “the rich are very different than you and me,” to which Ernest Hemingway replied “Yes, they have more money.”\n",
      "Our work highlights another key difference: the most affluent Americans not only have more income; they receive it—and pay taxes on it—in vastly different ways than the rest of us.\n",
      "For policy makers concerned about long-term fiscal shortfalls and high levels of economic inequality, our work reinforces the notion that raising the tax burden on the wealthy requires a special focus on how those households gain wealth and skirt taxes. We highlight four ways to effectively raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans.\n",
      "Most Americans receive almost all their income through wages and retirement income (pensions, 401(k)s, social security, and individual retirement accounts). The most recent available IRS data (2014) shows that wages and retirement income made up 94% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for households in the bottom 80% of the income distribution. Even for households in the 98th to 99th income percentile, wages and retirement income accounted for 71% of AGI.\n",
      "At the very, very top, though, these sources are less important, accounting for just 15% and 7% of the income of the top 0.01% and the top 0.001% of households, respectively. These households  receive most of their income from investments (interest, dividends, and especially realized capital gains) and businesses (including sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations). These items constituted 82% of income for the top 0.01% and 88% for the top 0.001%, compared to just 7% for the bottom 80% of households.\n",
      "These patterns are robust over time and data sources. And in practice, the tilt toward capital income at the top is even larger than these figures suggest because AGI does not include the massive unrealized capital gains and very sizable inheritances that accrue to many affluent households.\n",
      "Wages face heavier taxation than capital income, even though wages go mainly to low- and middle-income households and capital income goes mainly to high-income households. Most federal revenues are collected from wages. Payroll taxes account for 33% of federal revenues and are imposed solely on wages. Income taxes account for another 52% of federal revenues, and studies show that the share of income tax revenues that derive from capital income is quite small. These studies were performed before the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which further diminished the taxation of capital via special deductions for business and cuts in the top income tax rate, the corporate tax rate, and the estate tax.\n",
      "Moreover, the highest effective marginal income tax rates on wages exceed 40%, whereas much business income is taxed at a top rate below 30%, dividends and realized capital gains are taxed below 25%, and unrealized gains are not taxed until they are sold. As a result, the tax share of income paid by the very highest-income households is often lower than for middle-class households.\n",
      "There are many ways to raise taxes on the wealthy without  harming economic growth.  Here we highlight four options.\n",
      "Capital gains reform may be necessary if policymakers want to increase tax burdens on wealthy households. The simplest policy here would be the elimination of the step-up basis at death. Heirs would pay capital gains taxes on the taxable basis of the decedent who acquired the asset, instead of the basis of the asset at death. In 2020, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) staff calculated that terminating step-up that year would raise $104.9 billion over the next 10 years. Alternatively, capital gains could be taxed at death, and treated as though the decedent had sold that asset. Batchelder and Kamin (2019) used 2016 JCT predictions to estimate that taxing accrued gains at death and raising the capital gains rate to 28% would raise $290 billion between 2021 and 2030.\n",
      "Taxing intergenerational wealth transfers can make taxes more progressive and offset disparities in opportunity across income classes. Currently, less than 0.1% of all estates are subject to the estate tax, down from 7.65% in 1977.  As baby boomers die, they are set to pass down $72.6 trillion in assets to heirs. Taxing these transfers more heavily would reduce inequality, increase opportunity, and raise revenues.  The estate tax could be converted to an inheritance tax on recipients, with a reduced threshold of a million dollars for all gifts and inheritances (compared to the current threshold of almost $13 million) coupled with a tax rate that would equal the heir’s income tax rate plus some amount. This combined tax rate would integrate income and estate taxes. Since the heirs to wealthy estates are already usually in high tax brackets, the distributional impact would be similar to (though slightly less progressive than) the estate tax. This change has the political advantage of focusing on wealthy heirs, who were lucky enough to be the beneficiaries of wealthy relatives or friends, instead of targeting those who accumulated wealth.\n",
      "Eliminating the Section 199A deduction for qualified business incomes would target another key component of income for the wealthy.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) reduced the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 37%, and the deduction brought the effective rate on qualified business income down to 29.6%. In 2020, the Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimated that the deduction would lower federal revenues by $417 billion over the following 10 years. The deduction is inequitable: the TPC estimated that 55% of the direct tax benefits in 2019 would go to families in the top 1% of the income distribution and 26% of the benefits would go to the top 0.1%. Although the deduction was intended to increase employment and investment, the incentives for both are actually quite low given the complicated structure and non-targeted nature of the deduction.  Additionally, its complexity creates an opening for business owners to reduce their taxes by re-arranging and relabeling their investments and expenses, a practice which is further incentivized  by the increased difference between the effective tax rates on wages and business income.\n",
      "A final option would be to create a value added tax (VAT) coupled with a rebate or Universal Basic Income (UBI). This would leave the net tax burden smaller or unchanged for most households but would impose higher tax burdens on the wealthy. Currently, wealthy households can finance extravagant levels of consumption without even paying capital gains taxes on the accruing wealth by following a “buy, borrow, die” strategy, in which they finance current spending with loans and use their wealth as collateral. By avoiding realizing their capital gains, they can avoid taxes at the same time they enjoy a luxurious lifestyle. A VAT would tax consumption and hence would force the affluent to pay taxes on their lifestyle, even if they did not pay much in income tax. A VAT of 10%, combined with a UBI payment of the federal poverty line times the VAT rate times two, would raise about $2.9 trillion over 10 years. The Tax Policy Center estimates that this system  would be extremely progressive: after-tax income for the lowest quintile would increase by 17%, the tax burden for middle-income people wouldn’t change, and incomes for the top 1% of households would be reduced by 5.5%. The VAT would also function as a 10% tax on existing wealth, since future consumption can only be financed with existing wealth or future wages.\n",
      "Each of these proposals would undoubtedly face significant opposition from those who benefit from the challenge of taxing affluent households: the wealthy themselves. However, in order to face the dual concerns of ever-increasing national debt and rapidly growing inequality, it is a challenge that we must take on before it’s too late.\n",
